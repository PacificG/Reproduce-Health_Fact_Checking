# Reproducibility of Explainable Automated Fact-Checking for Public Health Claims

This repository is the implementation of [Explainable Automated Fact-Checking for Public Health Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09926). Also, this is the submission of our work under the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2021 Spring.
The repository reproduces the veracity prediction as mentioned in the paper with BERT(base-uncased) and Sci-BERT models. We acheive accuracy close to that mentioned in the paper.
