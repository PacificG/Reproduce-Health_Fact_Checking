The story explains early on that pRT is “not new” although it’s claimed that recent technology advances enable doctors to deploy it with better accuracy. The story calls this treatment a potential “boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed,” and includes a glowing personal endorsement by the study’s lead author. The story says pRF is “far cheaper” than steroid injections, but there’s no data on its cost. The story mentions interventions that are commonly recommended for low back pain, including waiting it out.",mixture,"This story describes research results presented at a radiology meeting that compared treating patients with lower back pain from disk herniation with either a pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) probe or multiple steroid injections. We also reviewed a news release about this research. Among the story’s strengths: It alerts readers that the study — presented as an abstract — has yet to be peer-reviewed and published, and it provides cautious comments from an independent source, although they appear at the very end. However, the story leaves readers in the dark about how the treatment was evaluated and what it costs, and misses some important limitations with the evidence. It largely ignored potential harms, including the possibility that some patients might be treated unnecessarily because the cause of back pain can be difficult to diagnose. Back pain is a common problem. Often it goes away with time and exercise. But chronic pain that does not respond to conservative treatment and includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica) is a leading cause of disability and an economic burden.

""There are enormous privacy implications from the one-end foreign rule, to be clear,"" Mayer said. Going on name alone, that sounds like the opposite of a license for the NSA to collect private messages between Americans. But to do so, the electronic footprint of that email needs to leave the confines of the United States. Oliver jumped in and asked Snowden to clarify that the racy picture — if you’ve seen the interview, you know we’re paraphrasing — wouldn’t necessarily have to be sent to Germany in order to end up in NSA storage.",true,"Snowden said, ""Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database."" In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out.

This could have provided readers with some insight about what this new product might add to the field. The story did not even provide a clear picture of what would be involved in treatment using the medical device highlighted, let alone outline the other options available for those with cardiovascular disease.",false,"This story is an example of what’s often missing in medical research stories in a business section. The story is about a new cardiovascular stent that may be available if it receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration. But the story does not provide much insight about the actual utility of implanting stents. The story quoted an investigator on the project as saying that there was a lower heart-attack rate in those patients receiving this new stent. However – the published study indicated that while there were fewer heart attacks, this difference was not statistically significant. Beyond this, it is a comparison of heart attack rates in individuals who received stents and does include any indication of how this rate compares to that seen in people receiving optimal medical therapy but who don’t get a stent. The story fails to deliver any independent perspective – only letting us hear from a company spokesman and one study investigator. Not everyone who reads medical research stories in a business section is interested primarily as a shareholder. Some people want more context, more on the quality of the evidence, more on the size of the potential benefits and harms, and more on what this thing is likely to cost them. This story – which reported more on the competition among or revenues for device manufacturers – didn’t help those readers. And when you think of it, why wouldn’t shareholders want that missing information as well?"

At least that’s what they want you to think, according to YourNewsWire: Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. The significance, in the case of that specific research paper, was that it demonstrated that these male cells — wherever they came from — were able to cross what is known as the blood-brain barrier — a semi-permeable membrane that prevents most chemicals in the blood from entering the brain. Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain.",false,"We are also unsure, for the record, what motivation would exist for scientists to hide the truth about male microchimerism in the first place."

48,48,Children in intensive care recover faster with little to no nutrition,"The release states that a new nutrition protocol has disproven a theory about standard care. But while the release points out that assumptions about parenteral feeding in children needed — and got — a good challenge, it fails to note that children most vulnerable to malnutrition sustained the most benefit from delayed parenteral feeding. We’ll call it Not Applicable. So while it doesn’t disease-monger, we’re hesitant to give the release credit here. There’s no information in the release about funding or potential conflicts of interest.",false,"This brief news release, issued by a university hospital system in Belgium, is loosely based on published results of a multinational, randomized clinical study designed to test the value of adding early intravenous macronutrient feedings to the nutritional care of critically ill children in intensive care units who are unable to eat or be fed normally. Such so-called “total” parenteral nutrition, delivered via the bloodstream, is commonplace in pediatric ICUs, researchers say, because of concerns that “macronutrient deficits” will lead to increased infections, weakness, and longer stays on ventilators and in ICUs overall. The problem, however, has been the dearth of rigorous scientific evidence for this assumption in children, and — significantly — growing evidence in studies of adults that the practice actually delays healing and increases infections. The study on which the release is based does indeed add strong clinical evidence that the same is true for children, and that delaying for a week or so the use of full parenteral feedings is clearly associated with lower rates of infections and earlier discharge from the ICUs. But this release could leave some readers with the misconception that starving critically ill children will hasten their recovery from a critical illness. Here’s why: contrary to the language in the release, the study did not “prove” the idea that “receiving little or no nutrition” in the first week of an ICU stay “makes children recover faster.” Nor were these children “fasting,” in the conventional sense. In fact, all of the children received micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), blood sugar controls, and “enteral” nutrition in which some nutrients are delivered through a tube from the nose to the stomach. The release further misleadingly implies that “nutritional deficiency” somehow directly leads to faster and better recoveries for seriously ill children; in fact, the authors of the published study report that the reason for the benefit of delaying total parenteral nutrition remains “speculative,” but possibly due to complex effects of digestion and metabolism that have an impact on the immune system. Although numbers are hard to come by (and the release makes no effort to find any) an estimated quarter million infants and children a year are admitted to intensive care units with critical illnesses and injuries. Scientists know that  the nutritional needs of children’s rapidly growing brains and bodies make their care trickier in some respects than adult care, and the use of intravenous feedings of a complete package of calories and specific nutrients are commonly started within 24 hours of an ICU stay. But few studies have been done to test the value of such feedings, usually given as supplements or sometimes in place of enteral feedings of some nutrients through a nasogastric tube. And studies in adults have strongly suggested that parenteral feedings are associated with higher rates of infection and longer ICU stays. This study matters because treatment of children in the ICU is not uncommon and the outcomes of interest (time in the ICU, complication rates, death) are important to everyone."

Well, maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the Panthers.”  But neither Bill Lee nor Hillary Clinton “defended” the Panthers, either in a public or a legal sense.

63,63,The Trump Administration’s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.,"In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:  Such mice are particularly valuable for HIV drug testing in part because tissue from a single human fetus can readily generate a group of 40 to 50 genetically identical mice, and because the animals can, unlike monkeys, be infected with the human virus, HIV. The department alleged that they were not “sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.” Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting “a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved” — in effect putting a “pause” on all research that relied on fetal tissue. In a grant report on that laboratory’s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:  Experiments in FY2016 revealed that our … humanized mouse model can be used in long-term studies (up to one year) with [Antiretroviral Therapy, ART] administered by injections or via an oral route (drugs incorporated into mouse chow). ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. Speaking to Science, Greene said that “Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML’s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.” In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to Science after the publication’s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think — or realize — such a move would have affected the study in question:  [In their statement, the NIH] said the agency in September “put a pause in place” for staff scientists procuring new human fetal tissue, “an action NIH thought was prudent given the examination of these procurements.",true,"Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019."

65,65,"Over 37 million bees were killed by a large GMO cornfield planted in Ontario, Canada.","Other than the title and the first sentence, Organic Health steered away from the idea that a GMO corn field caused 37 million bees to die in Canada and instead aligned with the conclusions drawn by the Post and CBC News: The culprit behind the devastating bee deaths in Canada is believed to be neonicotinoid pesticides: “What seems to be deadly to bees is that the neonicotinoid pesticides are coating corn seed and with the use of new air seeders, are blowing the pesticide dust into the air when planted.” While the idea that GMO corn is causing millions of bees to perish around the world is intriguing, it is also unproven. The likely route of exposure was insecticide contaminated dust generated during the planting of treated corn seed. The Organic Health article was basically a repurposed version of two articles published by The Post in June 2013 and CBC News in August 2013.

66,66,Selenium Supplements Might Give Modest Benefit Against Cholesterol,"The story states that many other studies have looked at the cholesterol impact of selenium supplements, with differing results. So, there’s really no need to talk about alternatives. The story notes that bread in the U.S. is a good source of selenium, and that U.S. consumers generally have no need to take a supplement. The story doesn’t exaggerate the prevalence of selenium deficiency or otherwise try to scare people into taking supplements. The Reuters story also described the ranges for normal and elevated cholesterol levels, which helps puts the changes observed into context.",true,"This story about selenium’s effects on cholesterol points out some key limitations in a new study. It explains that the trial was conducted in Britain, where people generally have lower selenium intakes than in the U.S. — so the results may not apply here. And it was careful not to suggest that selenium might be an alternate to statin drugs or other remedies for high cholesterol. The story did not provide as many details as the competing Reuters report on this study, however. The effects of selenium on cholesterol levels were not quantified, and there was no information on costs. Selenium is a component of multivitamins taken by millions of Americans on a daily basis. Selenium supplements are also taken individually in the hope that they will ward off chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. While there isn’t much evidence that supplementation reduces the risk of these diseases in healthy individuals (and might increase the risk of diabetes), the results of this new research at least provide some reassurance that selenium won’t raise your cholesterol, which might increase your cardiovascular risk."

The news release explains the specificity and sensitivity of the test. It also clearly discloses who funded the research. One downside is that it’s not until the final paragraph that we learn this is still experimental research that must be confirmed in larger studies. Earlier statements make it sound farther along, e.g., “researchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.” A larger concern is how the release downplayed the high-false positive rate of 64%, saying this “approaches” the false-positive rate of manual detection by expert dermatologist, which studies put at about 32%. Melanoma can be very difficult to diagnose so if doctors could use a tool that helped better screen suspicious-looking moles, they might be able to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and save lives.

77,77,New DNA Tests Aimed at Reducing Colon Cancer,"This story relies too heavily on researchers who are connected to the companies developing the cancer screens. Although the story doesn’t discuss existing stool tests like fecal immunochemical testing or other fecal occult blood testing, on the issue of relative novelty, the story scores points for being the only we reviewed that mentioned that the Exact Sciences DNA test is only one of two leading technologies being developed right now. The story also states that “Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high” – implying that the new test might be more cost-effective. Then we will know if this is a big step forward.” There was also no discussion of the limitations of drawing conclusions from an abstract presented at a scientific conference – something that has not yet undergone the kind of peer review that a journal would use. In so doing, the end of the story devolves a bit into a “my product is better than your product” tit for tat.",mixture,"Strengths:  Immediately, in the opening words, the story acknowledges that there is another DNA test in development that was reported on this week. It was the only one of the four stories we reviewed on this topic that made this clear. Weaknesses: It didn’t provide a meaningful comparison of the new approaches with existing colon cancer screening tests. It also has problems with how the underlying question is presented. Two examples:  “The new tests could help most people avoid colonoscopies, which are routinely prescribed for people over age 50.” – perhaps implying to the reader that evidence supports a recommendation of colonoscopy for everyone.That is not the case; there are several potential screening tests available, including other stool tests – something not mentioned in the story. “Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.” This sentence has a lot of information, but is also somewhat misleading. Use of colonoscopy is actually pretty good, and most people who don’t have one have never been asked, calling into question that people “don’t want to have one.” The cost effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. other screening techniques is a complex question, but suffice it to say that the new technology being studied is not likely to be more cost-effective overall (previous stool DNA tests have performed much worse (higher costs, lower efficacy) than colonoscopy in modeling studies. This topic is really about when we should pay attention to evidence about a new diagnostic test and how we should evaluate diagnostic tests in comparison with one another- a topic that is often inadequately discussed in both medicine and journalism."

The story does not mention that women could discuss an individualized screening schedule with their physician. Some women at higher-risk of breast cancer may be better candidates for annual screening between age 40-50 (or earlier, depending on family history or genetic markers), while others may not wish to screen until they are in their 50s or 60s. The story does not mention how physicians could counsel anxious patients on the true value of screening for breast cancer. The story does note that mass screening results in overtreatment and possibly unnecessary treatment for some women; however, the cost implications for such treatments are not discussed, an important omission at this time in the development of U.S. healthcare policy and physician reimbursements for screening. The story superbly cites expert epidemiologists and clinicians who discuss the problems with overselling mammograms and how this flies in the face of public health campaigns and U.S. clinical guidelines that women over 40 get annual mammograms. The story also cites a breast cancer survivor and advocate who questions the value of screening for some women. An advocate from a pro-screening group is also cited and her message is balanced by a clinician (who consults with the organization) who gives a tempered response to the latest data that screening may not benefit, and may even harm, women who are not at high-risk of developing aggressive breast cancer."

It also explains that Epclusa carries a warning that “serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral.” The FDA also warns that certain drugs may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which would reduce its effectiveness.,true,"This release announces the approval by the FDA of a new pill, Epclusa, for patients with chronic infections with Hepatitis C virus, also known as HCV.

Patients can be infected with different forms and require different treatments. The release informs on the novelty, harms and benefits of the drug but doesn’t give reporters — or lay readers — much background on the clinical trials that led to the approval. An estimated 120 million people have HCV infections worldwide, with an upper estimate of 3.9 million in the US alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new treatment — Epclusa — has an estimated cost of about $74,800 per 12-week necessary therapy length — or about $900 per pill.

The story mentions that using the wrist may better enable patients to avoid an ""expensive overnight hospital stay"" and that Medicare reimbursement was the same even though this route for catheterization may involve more physician time.

The story mentioned that arterial spasms tops the list of complications with this procedure and indicated that it was particularly problematic in ""little old ladies.""",true,"This is an engaging and important enterprise story that explained a number of important issues to be factored in when considering medical interventions. It also nicely highlights the tension that exists in the development of new and presumably less invasive approaches to cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. It’s refreshing to still find 1,600-word stories that go into such detail. It is clear from the story that:  Cardiologists are not of one mind about the value or benefit of doing cardiac catheterizations thorugh the radial artery in the wrist as opposed to the femoral artery in the groin. Different physicians value patient comfort differently. Different physicians may be more comfortable with, and better with, certain procedures. However what was lacking from this story was an examination of the overall success rate of the intended procedure. While patient comfort surely has value, procedure outcome is vital. We never learned any data about whether the actual goal of opening an artery is any better one way or another. Interestingly, the cited meta analysis is only partially acknowledged. While a trend was noted toward an advantage to the radial artery approach (in terms of bleeding and procedural outcome), the authors concluded a large randomized trial is necessary to determine the true value of the approach. And that wasn’t mentioned in the story. Overall, though, the story delivers a clear picture of why patients need to have conversations with their caregivers about the risks and benefits of the various options available for their treatment. Being aware that there is often not a single answer to questions about the course of action is an important step towards making decisions that will get you the care that is best for you.

We don’t know how many of the 80 patients had the abnormality, if the MRI required special equipment or software, and if these were findings that any radiologist could detect. That’s simply too many gaps to make the story reliable. Study authors’ comments came from a news release. To its credit, the story did include cautious comments from one observer at the end. The challenge for this story is they are reporting on a basic science study, just one that happens to use MRI rather than bench techniques and one that was published in a specialized, technical journal. Autism is one of the most polarizing subjects in health, and the press can bear a big part of the blame. Reporting on autism tends to rely heavily on celebrity spokespeople, anecdotal profiles and advocacy organizations. It also has relied too much on science that has been improved upon or even discredited.

Similarly, the third author, Mark Levie, is a paid consultant for Bayer and on the company’s speaker’s bureau, according to a disclosure from a medical conference.

According to rules from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, the authors themselves are granted the authority to determine who meets the criteria to be listed as an author on an academic paper. Critics of these rules have pointed to the ease with which they are circumvented by industry.",false,"In this news release Bayer HealthCare summarizes a long overdue post-market report on the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of Essure, an implant and procedure designed to bring about permanent contraception in women. It is the first permanent sterilization alternative to tubal ligation. The Essure implant is a small metal and polyester-like coil that when placed in the fallopian tubes causes an inflammatory response. The resulting scar tissue that develops over a three-month period prevents sperm from entering the fallopian tubes. Given mounting concerns about the safety of this device, it is crucial for any news release addressing safety to present a complete and balanced portrait of clinical research findings. But this news release is unacceptably one-sided. It never mentions that nearly a third of the women originally enrolled in this study dropped out for various reasons that could reflect a bad experience with the device (e.g. adverse events or pregnancy). It also understates the levels of pelvic pain reported by women who did complete the five-year study, and it never discloses that the study’s lead author (and source quoted in the news release) is a paid consultant to Bayer. When Essure was approved in 2002, the FDA required the original manufacturer to monitor the outcomes of women who were enrolled in a clinical trial, upon which the agency’s approval was based, for an additional four years. While this news release summary of the report portrays a successful product and process with few serious side effects, several news stories published days before the news release paint a very different picture. According to articles in the New York Times and other media, thousands of women are now asking the FDA to remove Essure from the market and inform the public about risks associated with the implant. Several others have filed legal action against Bayer, which acquired the implant from Conceptus in 2013. The Times article stated that the FDA has received more than 4,000 adverse event reports on Essure and that the original manufacturer received 16,047 complaints from women who had undergone Essure implants. In addition, ABC News in San Francisco reported that dozens of women staged a protest outside an obstetricians meeting while calling for the implant to be removed from the market. Another ABC affiliate in Arizona reported that the FDA will respond to a “Citizen’s Petition” signed by more than 2,100 women asking that Essure be taken off the market. It’s important that the safety of the device be given a fair public hearing so women considering sterilization can make informed judgments about the implants vis–à–vis tubal ligation. It should be noted that Conceptus, the original manufacturer, failed to report the outcome of the five-year study and that the results were submitted for publication a year after Bayer acquired the device. It’s a disappointment that this summary report was delayed nine long years after the study was completed and 13 years after the FDA approved the device."

The release begins with a straightforward statement that this is the first study to demonstrate benefits of early referral to palliative care for terminally ill cancer patients. Did health care utilization decrease by 1%?,mixture,"This news release reports results of a study that found that patients with advanced cancers who were referred early to palliative care made better use of support services, including palliative chemotherapy, after being discharged and had fewer hospital re-admissions and invasive treatments. Researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital obtained their data through a prospective cohort study (one that follows a group of patients over time to observe specific outcomes). Unfortunately, the absolute numbers — readily available in the study — showing the results were not included in the news release. But the release does provide good context in other areas, particularly in explaining what palliative care is and what it entails for patients. In an era when ethical and economic issues surrounding end-of-life care loom increasingly large, this study addresses a critical issue. As the release points out, palliative care has positive implications for emotional and other quality of life issues for patients. In contrast, extensive time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, drives up costs and is frequently in conflict with patients’ explicitly expressed wishes. That being the case, it is all the more important that a news release about this issue provide the information readers need to judge the quality of the research method and put the results in context. As the authors of the journal article state: “Our findings are particularly important because multiple studies suggest that patients with advanced cancer often do not understand their actual prognosis or goals of chemotherapy; when they do not, these patients are more likely to receive nonbeneficial interventions, which contribute to increased suffering.” Many patients with advanced cancer are classic cases of those who receive too much care, which is of no benefit. Not only that, it adds to their pain, anxiety, and degrades their and their families quality of life. Its costs can be exorbitant, with some chemotherapy drugs costly upwards of $15,000 per month."

In a 2015 statement provided to Sydney Morning Herald reporter Nick Bryant by John Hopkins University, the institution made clear the results were far too preliminary to declare such accuracy or to speculate on its future success: “[Andraka’s’] idea was considered by his mentor to be of scientific interest,” the hospital told me in a written statement, “but his experiments at Johns Hopkins were highly preliminary.” They represented nothing more than “the very earliest stages of determining whether such a test is feasible or likely”.

Informed of Hadley’s analysis, California consultant Peter Harbage, an author of the center report cited by Wolff, said by email that Hadley’s analysis counted certain expenditures, such as government aid for graduate medical education, as helping to cover the costs of the uninsured. Kaiser, he said, assumed more government spending on the uninsured, reducing the costs that could be shifted to private insurance rates, and also did not assume that every health care provider invariably maximizes profits, which Families USA did. PolitiFact in Washington reviewed the Families USA and Kaiser studies and did not see obvious problems or conflicts.",false,"Wolff said uncompensated health care costs absorbed by Texas hospitals are adding $1,800 a year to private insurance rates.

Likewise, were the regenerated brain tissue and blood vessels normal? It’s made quite clear this is research in mice that is not currently applicable to humans. A quick search of ongoing research in this area reveals several things are being tried including drugs, growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, stem cells, and even brain stimulation techniques.",mixture,"The news release summarizes a study on whether a gel — introduced into stroke-damaged areas of mouse brains — can stimulate the regrowth of neurons and blood vessels. The findings suggest that it can. But that’s a far cry from proving that this regrowth can function as normal brain tissue and, therefore, be “stroke-healing” in humans. Still, the news release is one of the better releases we’ve seen in terms of  making it clear that the study was in mice. Mice is referenced in the headline and throughout. Compared to many news releases we review that have to do with rodent research, this one was also more cautious with its language than most. A more substantial discussion of the harms and benefits of this experimental treatment would have made the release even stronger. This study is part of a growing body of research called “stroke neural repair,” referring to the  replacement of brain tissue damaged by a lack of blood flow, with new brain tissue. Although stroke is declining as a cause of death in the US, the fact that mortality from stroke is declining faster than the incidence, means we’re likely to see an increase in the number of people who become chronically disabled from the disease. That’s why there’s such intense interest in repairing brain tissue damaged from stroke. As further headway is made in this important area of research, some key questions for journalists and readers will be: is the new growth really functioning brain tissue? If so, how do we know it’s truly functional? And ultimately, the most difficult question of all, can it work in an integrated way with the rest of the brain?"
120,120,Zinc eaten at levels found in biofortified crops reduces 'wear and tear' on DNA,"Since there is no discussion of costs in this news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. While this study was about food fortified with zinc, the news release was vague about how people should acquire their zinc, and this confusion could encourage people to reach for a bottle of zinc supplements. In the original journal article, researchers mention the zinc fortification programs initiated in more than 30 countries and point out how Bangladesh increased its rice zinc concentration by 50 percent through its biofortification methods. Additional funding came from the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements. We only know from the news release that the six-week study was randomized and controlled, as “scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism.” We aren’t told how many people participated in the trial, how they took the zinc (through meals or supplementation), how much zinc was given and whether the study was blinded.",false,"This news release describes a new study looking at the correlation between zinc intake and DNA damage and consequently makes a case for biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat. Although the release does an exemplary job explaining the role zinc plays in our bodies, it doesn’t quite explain how this brief, small trial of 18 healthy men demonstrates the impact of zinc on cellular health. It uses vague, broad language to describe the study’s findings and dedicates only one sentence to detail the study design. Part news release, part policy article and part biofortification promotion, the release argues for the need for food-based interventions, like crop biofortification, to address malnutrition and mineral deficiency around the world based on a small study of 18 healthy American men. That may be due to the fact that the research was funded by HarvestPlus, a research program advocating for biofortification to breed higher levels of micronutrients directly into staple food crops. We wish this funding source was disclosed in the news release, as well as the question of how prevalent the practice of biofortification already is around the world. Most US news releases relate studies like this one to dietary supplements, but this news release addresses hidden hunger and malnutrition. Zinc deficiency is a public health issue in many developing countries, especially those with rice-based diets. Access to seafood, red meat and poultry (foods rich in zinc) is also a challenge for many vulnerable populations. If crop biofortification is proven to be a safe, reliable and cost-effective way to deliver essential vitamins and minerals to nutrient-deficient populations, then it should be seen as a much needed food-based intervention to improve global health."

The story makes good use of possibly disinterested experts, but their cautious statements may be overmatched by happy consumers and radiologists who have invested in the technology. The important caveat, appearing but perhaps overwhelmed in the story, is that it is not yet known whether the test works as well as current technologies (mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI), nor whether it can improve health outcomes. Whether or not it is cheaper than another test is less relevant than whether the information generated has clinical value. If this story had provided some hard data about how well or poorly this new test performs in relation to standard practice, we would have thought more highly of it.

149,149,Encouraging clinical results for an antibody drug to prevent or treat HIV,"The release could do a better job of explaining that this is a very limited study looking primarily at safety. When the release states “among 13 HIV-infected people who received the highest dose of 10-1074, 11 showed a rapid decline in the amount of virus” — we need to know what that means. The drug must still undergo considerable research on larger groups of patients before its value is proven. The release doesn’t include a discussion of actual safety results of the study drug, although this is the primary goal of the study. Encouraging clinical results for an antibody drug to prevent or treat HIV",mixture,"While this study of a clinical trial of a new biologic agent called 10-1074 is understandably exciting for HIV researchers — it involved just 33 people (19 individuals who were infected with HIV and 14 who were not) — and lacked important detail which would have made it more meaningful for the rest of us. We give the release credit for acknowledging that the biologic drug is still preliminary and needs to be tested in a larger trial, but that caution seems overshadowed by the other premature projections made in the release. The stated purpose of the research was “to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans” but the news release didn’t tell us the actual results of the trial and what this might mean in the larger context of HIV treatment. We know that antiretrovirals — the current therapy  — can cause severe side effects and require lifelong treatment. But highlighting a new approach without talking about its potential drawbacks seems to be premature. We hope that “broadly’ neutralizing antibodies is part of an alternate treatment strategy, but without more detail, is it too soon to be getting HIV-infected patients hopes up?"

Bronchial thermoplasty is indeed a relatively new approach to treating asthma. The story does warn of risks.

The story does a commendable job on many of our criteria, but then it stumbles on the fundamental question of how much of an advance the new treatment really is. It also fails to alert readers to financial ties between researchers and the company now marketing a bronchial thermoplasty device. When someone says a new treatment is better, it is imperative to ask, “Better than what?” By failing to tell readers that most of the people in the control group also improved during the key test of this asthma treatment device, this story paints an overly rosy view.

166,166,Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed at Cedars-Sinai: New blood tests will speed up diagnosis for the most common GI disorder,"While the release does note the overall size (“nearly 3,000 people”) and general outlines of the study, it’s characterization of the evidence is misleading. The tests are a significant advance, but are still far from foolproof — after all, “more than 90 percent accurate” is also “almost 10 percent inaccurate.” Further, it’s not clear how many cases of IBS are caused by food poisoning, or whether identifying such patients with this test will improve their outcomes. You may have to try a few treatments to see what works best for you.” Or, as the Mayo Clinic summarizes, “treatment focuses on the relief of symptoms so that you can live as normally as possible.” Even without a confirmed diagnosis of IBS, patients would be able to share symptoms with their doctors. The release exaggerates the potential impact of the test in a way that promotes a commercial interest, so we’ll flag it for disease mongering. Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed at Cedars-Sinai: New blood tests will speed up diagnosis for the most common GI disorder",false,"Image from ibschek.com The release states that two “simple” new blood tests can be used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by detecting antibodies that signal the presence of toxins that can cause IBS. This diagnosis, in turn, would allow patients to receive treatment more quickly. But the release has many problems that start with the headline, which claims there is now a “definitive” test for IBS. That’s an exaggeration, as the findings need further validation and they apply only to a subset of patients with diarrhea as their main symptom — something the release never explains. The release also glosses over some significant points — such as the fact that there were only 43 control patients (too small a group to draw “definitive” conclusions), and that there’s no evidence that treating patients based on these test results will actually improve their outcomes. The cost of the test and its potential harms — e.g. false-positive results that lead to unnecessary or misguided treatment — also aren’t explored in any way. [Editor’s note: We’ve also published a review of a CBS News story about the test that shares many of the same shortcomings as this release.] While it’s not clear how many people suffer from IBS, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDKD) reports that IBS affects at least 3 percent of the adult population — and probably closer to 10 or 15 percent of the adult population. The term “IBS” refers to a range of bowel symptoms including pain, constipation, and/or diarrhea. IBS is not meant to represent a single underlying cause, but in fact may represent a number of different conditions that result in functional bowel symptoms. This news release refers to an attempt to develop a test to better categorize certain patients with IBS. Though the news release implies the test is for all patients with IBS, in fact it evaluated two tests for individuals with IBS who had diarrhea as the predominant symptom. The implication that these tests may provide a diagnosis for IBS more broadly is not correct. Whether these tests hold up as being accurate when applied more broadly to patients with IBS and other related bowel conditions remains to be proven. It would also be important to see how common the test is positive in individuals without chronic bowel symptoms. Finally, even if these tests are specific for individuals with diarrhea-predominant IBS, it’s unclear if it would make any difference in their treatment or lead to a reduction in the severity of symptoms. That’s a premise that still needs to be tested."

171,171,Is it Brain Infection or Cancer? A New Rapid Test Could Hold the Answer,"The closing line of the release also specifies how a larger sample population is needed both in adults and kids. We didn’t note any sensational language. Funding sources and potential conflicts of interest — or a lack thereof — weren’t noted in the release. Back pain can be an issue, too, as can bleeding at the site of the puncture. In a cursory check, we also found no evidence that the authors gained to benefit from widespread use of the Luminex FlexMAP 3D assay system, which is key to the rapid analysis of spinal tap samples.",mixture,"This news release promotes a study in the journal PLoS ONE by researchers at Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. The crux: Even basic problems with the brain and other parts of the central nervous system, or CNS, are not only serious but also tough to diagnose — and especially so in rapid fashion. According to the release, a test that uses a little cerebrospinal fluid, or CNF, gathered from a patient’s spine might help doctors quickly narrow down whether they are dealing with an infection (by a virus, bacteria, or fungus) or some other issue, such as a demyelinating disease or cancer. The key to making this possible are cytokines — tiny proteins that cells release to sound the alarm to one another — and a device that can quickly test a small sample of CNF for dozens of different cytokines and their abundances. The release’s title does a decent job of not selling the moon, since it does not promise the “holy grail” of identifying a specific problem with one test — just the presence of an infection or something else. However, the teasing of a rapid doctor’s office-style test when one does not yet exist, and when the sample size is so small (43 people with a wide variety of issues participated) seems dubious — especially when one of its own authors says additional research is needed to confirm the core findings. It’s also important to highlight that this early data is a “retrospective analysis,” which means that even if the sample size of patients were bigger, it would only suggest that further prospective work needed to be done to validate the testing in patients. Problems with brains and spinal cords are often tough to diagnose. This is because infections by bacteria, fungi, and viruses can manifest similarly to other issues, like cancer or autoimmune diseases. The blood-brain barrier makes sampling the fluid that can hint at what’s going on tricky and painful — so making the most use of a sample is best. It’s especially key with the youngest patients, whose still-developing bodies and immature immune systems may not be prepared to handle major problems like encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)and also can’t describe their symptoms. If a one-stop test existed that could help doctors rapidly narrow down a long list of suspects for a CNS problem, it could save valuable time and financial resources, and potentially patients’ lives. If this test can be validated it could conceivably improve speed of diagnosis in order to get the most appropriate treatment."

173,173,"Brain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders","The news release goes into some detail about the number of people and hours of brain activity that were measured, with 333 different areas of participants’ brains identified and compared. That’s a preliminary step that is needed, but it’s still preliminary. Brain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders A sample of nine people is small, but 10 hours of data per volunteer provided researchers with 90 hours of fcMRI data to analyze. No mention is made of discomforts or potential dangers associated with MRIs.",false,"This news release reports findings from a study of functional MRI (fcMRI) scans in which researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people. During the scans, each person performed a variety of tasks to determine the extent to which their behaviors altered the picture of their brain activity. The researchers found that each person’s brain imaging changed little from day-to-day or task-to-task. That is, the brain scans appeared to reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain. The release suggests that, based on these findings, its possible to use this type of brain scan to diagnose individual traits or diseases. That is very premature. Diagnostic tests have yet to be developed. The release headline promises more than the news release delivers, and there’s a real question as to whether this information is useful to the public, or just misleading. The heading of this news release proclaims hopefully that “Brain scans may help diagnose neurological, psychiatric disorders.”  Whereas at present depression, bipolar disorder, and many other mental illnesses can only be diagnosed based on self-reported symptoms or observations of behavior, this release suggests we are on the verge of being able to diagnose these conditions via a particular type of MRI. However, the study referred to simply laid the groundwork for research testing whether functional networks in individuals’ brains are relatively stable over time. Diagnostic applications remain to be developed."
174,174,Prostate cancer treatment may spark heart problems,"In addition, while this story reported that “[p]revious studies have found hormone therapy given to prostate cancer patients with a history of heart disease increases their chances of dying,” it failed to tell readers that this latest study found that men with a previous history of heart disease had a less pronounced increase in risk of an event. Prostate cancer treatment may spark heart problems Indeed, the story ignored the key finding that different hormonal therapies were associated with different heart disease risks, thus raising the possibility that treatment choices could be refined. Plenty of caveats. According to a news release, the study was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Stockholm Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK.",mixture,"Although this story tries to put things in perspective, the headline and lead sentences push readers onto shaky ground that is not supported by the evidence presented. It jumps back and forth between evidence and speculation. This story improperly presents hormone therapy as a single type of treatment and the choice for patients being to either get “it” or not. In fact, there are several varieties of hormonal approaches used in prostate cancer treatment and this study found that different therapies were associated with different levels of heart disease risk, thus raising the possibility that refining treatment choices could minimize the concerns. The study was an observational review of heart disease among men being given hormonal therapies for prostate cancer. The story should have made clear that this type of study cannot establish cause-and-effect. What’s more, the study design appears to have serious limitations that are not addressed in the story. This last point highlights one hazard of reporting on presentations at medical meetings; unlike articles published in leading journals, meeting presentations do not undergo formal peer review. As a result, weaknesses in the design, gaps in the data and alternative explanations may be undeclared… and then unreported by journalists."

Politicians were also urged to negotiate at European Union and national level to ensure agricultural policy took account of public health issues. Cutting salt intake substantially reduces blood pressure, helping to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. “This is a big ticket item.

Women Taking Calcium Supplements May Risk Heart Health, Researchers Say The story does not provide readers with any information about possible alternatives, saying only that women should be making sure that they get a maximum of 1,500 milligrams of calcium from both their diets and supplements combined. The story also addresses the study’s limitations, saying, “And in an accompanying journal editorial, medical professors Dr. Bo Abrahamsen and Dr. Opinder Sahota wrote that due to study limitations, ‘it is not possible to provide reassurance that calcium supplements given with vitamin D do not cause adverse cardiovascular events or to link them with certainty to increased cardiovascular risk. Instead, it says repeatedly that the scientific consensus is still forming and that there may not be any dramatic clinical practice changes as a result of this latest study.",true,"It’s a difficult task given the sheer volume of research and the differences between the studies in question. The story mostly succeeds and deserves praise for taking a cautious tone. We would have liked to have seen more of the evidence presented in absolute terms, though, to help readers understand the significance of the findings. As with many of the findings coming out of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study, research related to calcium and heart health can leave consumers confused and even scared. Does calcium in a regular, balanced diet raise a person’s risk of having a heart attack or stroke or does this only apply to calcium supplements? And might the effect of those supplements be mitigated by other components of a person’s diet? All of these are questions that arise out of the series of studies that have begun to pile up in recent years. This story goes a long way toward answering some of them, but it also may leave readers confused on several points."

According to the study,  those who did have a CTA scan ended up having more invasive coronary angiograms and coronary opening procedures in the months following the scan. These alternatives are named in the published study. But the 40% drop in heart attacks noted in the 5-year follow-up period is a relative reduction.",false,"This brief news release describes a single positive finding from the 4,000-patient SCOT-HEART study:  roughly half of patients with stable chest pain who were randomized to receive computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and standard care had fewer heart attacks over 5 years than those who received standard care alone. But there’s a flaw in the headline and first sentence of the release. This study shows zero difference in deaths, and as the authors acknowledge in the published study, the entire difference between the groups was driven by non-fatal heart attacks. Another problem with the news release is that these benefits are expressed in dramatic relative terms, instead of the much more modest (and helpful) absolute terms. Readers are left with little guidance regarding what may account for the slight drop, and if this really represents a “major” reduction as claimed by the lead author. Finally, readers would have been better served if a discussion of alternative screening methods, conflicts of interest, and potential downstream costs and risks had been included. As a positive, the release mentions the potential to avoid invasive testing via angiogram, which has a very real death rate. What may really be at issue here is whether roughly $1 million scanners are truly better than the non-invasive tests we already have. It remains unclear which patients benefit most from these tests, whether the scans provide actionable information (or simply lead to further confirmatory tests), and what will be their true costs."

The story pegs the cost of Xtandi, one of the two drugs studied, at more than $10,000 for a 30-day supply, That’s useful information.",mixture,"This story summarizes the results of two studies involving drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. The main takeaway from the story is that in certain men with high-risk cancers who’ve already had their prostates removed, the drugs extended the amount of time before these men’s cancer spread beyond the prostate. The story helpfully quantifies the amount of time the drugs bought these men in absolute terms. But the story missed some important context. For example, the story is totally silent on the issue of adverse effects and how many patients suffered them. And it doesn’t caution that the outcome reported in the study — “metastasis-free survival” — may not translate to a corresponding increase in patients’ overall length of life. Disease-mongering was also a concern. The story features statistics about the huge numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed each year, but it doesn’t acknowledge that most of these cancers will never progress to cause problems for the patient. Moreover, it erroneously suggests that prostate removal is the “typical” approach to the treatment of early prostate cancer, when no treatment at all is the approach favored by about half of all men who receive such a diagnosis. An independent source would probably have helped bring some balance to the coverage, but the only experts quoted had a vested interest in the research. Despite having their prostates removed, men with aggressive forms of prostate cancer face a higher risk of having that cancer spread beyond the prostate. There is currently little that such men can do following initial treatment except watch and wait, but these preliminary results suggest that certain drugs may delay the spread of these cancers. Until the results are published and scrutinized by other researchers, however, it’s best to reserve judgment and view the claims of vested interests skeptically."

The story reports that this drug works on a gene mutation seen in only 4 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis.",false,"More than 20 years after researchers identified the genetic mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), a treatment aimed at the cause of the disease, rather than its effects, has shown it can improve lung function and some other measures in patients with a rare form of the disease. While this story accurately reports key drug trial results and provides some context, it falls short in important ways by failing to note that there is not yet evidence the drug is safe for life-long use or can extend lives; and that it is unlikely to cure CF by itself. The story doesn’t tell readers that drug is likely to come with an extremely high price tag. It fails to note that the CF Foundation, whose CEO is prominently quoted touting the drug, has funded the drug’s development and may stand to profit from its sales. Cystic fibrosis affects only about 70,000 people worldwide, but it is the most common lethal genetic disease in whites, slowly destroying their lungs and other organs. Since the primary CF mutation was identified in 1989, researchers have sought a treatment that would correct the underlying defect. As the story reports, this trial is an important proof of concept; it is a ‘big deal’ in the decades-long effort to find a treatment for the genetic defect underlying CF. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the long, hard road traveled to reach this point and the years of work ahead that will be needed to determine if this sort of treatment can lengthen the lives of typical CF patients."

202,202,Overcoming Fear of Back Pain May Spur Recovery,"While the background for the intervention is discussed in detail, the nature of the study is barely mentioned. This is especially the case with respect to the use of MRI to scan the brains of participants for “morphological” changes — a part of the research that was especially meaningful to the investigators because, in their view, the absence of such changes in the experimental group suggests that such changes are not necessarily a good indicator of pain control or pain abatement. Overcoming Fear of Back Pain May Spur Recovery patients “should learn to put pain into the right perspective and…avoid fear of moving”) may impose additional burdens on some pain patients. There aren’t many details about the people in the study, including the substantial age range (18 to mid-60s); the sources of the back pain; the way the pain was measured before and after the interventions, and so on.",mixture,"This article, based on findings of a small study of people with chronic back pain in Belgium reported in the journal JAMA Neurology, tells readers that if they can only “think differently” and stop “fearing” their pain, such attitude changes combined with “cognition-targeted motor control training” does significantly more than standard physical therapy and back pain “education” to reduce the pain and increase ability to function. The problem is that the story doesn’t really explain the differences between the standard and experimental therapies, the latter of which is composed of a sort of physical “desensitization” to feared physical movements; and fails to offer any details about the base level of the subjects’ pain, how pain was measured, or why the researchers looked for (and didn’t find) brain changes in the study group. We were glad the article included an outside expert, who makes clear that the experimental intervention is time intensive, costly, not covered by insurance and  — although “promising” — still unproven with respect to long-term benefit compared to standard therapies. That provided some much needed information for the reader. (Note: Due to an editing error, this story originally was marked with a 2-star score. It has been updated to reflect the correct rating of 3 stars.) This study focuses on behavioral and educational approaches designed to reframe how patients think about their pain. By emphasizing that “hurt doesn’t mean harm,” the hope is that patients will become more active and that activity may actually reduce pain. This “pain catastrophizing” theory is not really new. As such the description of this study doesn’t make clear what is different from prior studies evaluating this approach. Nonetheless, such efforts are important and need to be replicated in larger studies, so were glad the story ended on that note."

Both high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods are widely available. The release did not use many numbers to quantify the benefits of consuming one diet over another. Some would no doubt savor such a diet, but others might be turned off.",false,"A single, brief study from Norway claims to demonstrate that saturated fats are generally beneficial for most people, in contrast to much research that suggests potential heart risks are associated with higher saturated fat intake. The study of 38 men with abdominal obesity took place over a 12-week period and compared the effects of either a high carbohydrate or a high fat diet. This study, though randomized, only measured markers of risk such as blood pressure and triglycerides (not actual heart disease) for a short period of time. Current recommendations regarding fat intake are based on actual rates of heart disease found in large groups of people followed for years. It’s not unreasonable to raise questions about the role of saturated fat in heart disease. Researchers readily acknowledge that existing studies on the issue have important limitations. However, this release goes too far in describing the significance of this single small study, and gives no acknowledgment to evidence that cuts the other way. The release also lacks information expected of a solid account of a new nutrition study — such as a measurable benefit, harms, and details of the diet’s contents. Substantial claims require substantial evidence. This release claims to present data that upends the conventional wisdom on dietary fat, but it doesn’t acknowledge that the study has important limitations. Nor does it acknowledge the many other studies that have addressed the same questions examined by this research. People are already confused enough about what they should be eating.

212,212,FDA Clears P-Cure Upright Imaging Solution  for Proton Therapy Enhancement,"If not, then does it make it any easier, more comfortable or shorter? It causes more discomfort. As such, there is a comparison. It points out that standard proton therapy may radiate healthy body parts inadvertently. The release is basically arguing that the device will decrease the cost for the center per patient treated, and will accomplish this by making it easier to get treatment done and make it more accessible, affording extra time to bring in more patients.",mixture,"P-Cure Ltd. device We’re fully prepared to believe that there are ways to more accurately administer proton beam therapy with fewer side effects and lower costs. This release makes just those claims and yet provides nothing to back the claims up. There is no quantification of benefits. No true exploration of risks. No explanation of the quality of the evidence. And no true comparison of alternatives. The release muddies the water on what kind of nod it got from the US’s regulatory agency. The company received FDA “clearance” to market the device but not an “approval.” (See the discussion under the Quality of Evidence criteria.) Proton beam therapy represents an alternative form of radiotherapy compared to conventional x-rays. Interest in this form of therapy has grown based upon its ability to deliver higher doses of radiation to a smaller field. This may improve the benefit and reduce the harm for patients with cancer who need radiotherapy. Although not a focus in this release, the proven outcomes of proton vs. conventional radiotherapy in terms of benefits (increased survival) and harms (less damage to surrounding normal tissue) are less clear than the proponents of proton therapy would like to admit. For many cancers, conventional therapy may be adequate. Here the question is whether the delivery of proton beam therapy to patients who are getting it can be enhanced by delivering the treatment to the patient in a seated compared to a flat position. One can imagine for some patients that may lead to a more comfortable treatment, but it isn’t clear how many would derive a measurable benefit. The release focuses on decreases in the discomfort of treatment and implies that some who may not otherwise tolerate this therapy could now have it. All interesting, but no information is provided to support the release’s claims. Finally, the release focuses on the potential benefits to the proton beam center in terms of its costs — but patients will have other questions about cost such as whether the device is more expensive than what the center is currently using. If so, those costs may be passed on to insurers and thus patients based upon the specifics of their policy.

The release neglects to point out that even after this phase 2 trial has been completed, researchers won’t know if the experimental drug cocktail is better or worse than standard treatments, because it does not include any direct comparison. The release puffs up the threat of multiple myeloma, which accounts for less than 2 percent of cancer cases in the US. It does not explain that patients would be responsible for many of the costs of this treatment, in part because of overlaps with standard care.

231,231,Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain,"This article was refreshingly free of the overheated rhetoric about the “agonies” of chronic low back pain—and the need for novel treatment breakthroughs— that often permeate media features. The article provided the reader with an adequate amount of information about the study design and the inherent difficulties in interpretation of existing studies. Manipulation is an age-old treatment. The article did include expert commentary by a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association. However, the systematic review that served as the focus of the article is complex and somewhat difficult to decipher, with outcomes including pain and function at different time points.",true,"The article focused on a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain. The Cochrane Collaboration review found that this popular treatment leads to rapid short-term pain relief and improvement in function. But the magnitude of the treatment effect was modest at best. And manipulation did not provide a “clinically significant” advantage over other common treatments for chronic low back pain, according to this review. The HealthDay article made a key observation about chronic back pain: that there is no “silver bullet” for it. And it provided a brief but fair description of the systematic review and the evidence it considered. Our reviewers could have gone either way on several of the graded criteria, so the 4-star final score may be a bit deceiving. What were some of the shortcomings of this article? The article had a misleading title: “Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain”. This systematic review looked at the effects of manipulation as practiced by multiple professions rather than the impact of chiropractic per se. Since the review concluded that manipulation is a viable treatment for chronic back pain, one can argue that it supports rather than questions this manual therapy. It might have been useful to ask an impartial expert how the new review on manipulation compares with other recent reviews of the evidence in this area. And how manipulation compares with other effective treatments for chronic back pain. Readers of this article might well have come away with the impression that all treatments for chronic back pain offer similar results. This is not the case. Of the 200 or so therapies for chronic back pain in the medical marketplace, no treatment consistently offers a major benefit. Only a few have been proven to provide a moderate benefit for chronic back pain. The most influential U.S. guideline found only six treatments, including manipulation, where there was “good” evidence of a “moderate benefit” for chronic back pain (See Chou et al., 2007; Chou et al., 2009). An influential British review concluded that three general approaches (exercise, manual therapy including manipulation, and acupuncture) provide roughly equal benefit in the early management of persistent back pain. (See NICE, 2009). So the new review on manipulation is reasonably consistent with the larger evidence picture. It would have been useful if the article could have highlighted this point—since it offers an important message for people with chronic back pain. Based on this body of evidence, they shouldn’t be expecting heroic cures. Rather, they should look for validated treatments that can help them stay comfortable and active—and that align with their values, expectations and tolerance for risk.

The 2007 National Health Interview Survey concluded that roughly 8.6% of U.S. adults—close to 20 million individuals—utilized chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation. Despite its popularity, spinal manipulation is still commonly referred to as a “complementary/alternative” therapy rather than a mainstream treatment. Though it enjoys considerable support in systematic reviews and guidelines, spinal manipulation remains somewhat controversial and is not widely available in primary care medical settings. It does not enjoy completely consistent support from insurance companies. So determining the optimal role of manipulation in the management of chronic low back pain—in both chiropractic and conventional medical settings— is an important priority."

244,244,Single Dose of Hallucinogenic Drug Psilocybin Relieves Anxiety and Depression in Patients with Advanced Cancer,"Did the benefits outweigh these effects? That earns it a satisfactory rating here. No disease mongering here. The release would have been much stronger if it had compared the pros and cons of this treatment method with other treatment methods. The release does an adequate job of describing the study: the number of patients, their clinical background, the study design.",mixture,"This release focuses on a recent study that found a single application of the hallucinogen psilocybin is effective at providing meaningful relief to cancer patients suffering from severe depression or anxiety. The release notes that 80 percent of participants showed improvement based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression for several months following the treatment. The study is one of two on the subject that were published recently in the Journal of Psychopharmacology (our review of the release for the other study can be found here and a review of a related news article can be read here.) The release does better than its counterpart in terms of addressing conflicts of interest and placing the work in context with previous work in the field. However, the release uses only vague language when addressing the key issues of health benefits and adverse side effects. More specifics on the degree of reduced anxiety and depression scores would have been useful. Because this study and its counterpart offer an intriguing finding — that a single dose of something could be so helpful in alleviating depression — we’ve completed three reviews related to these studies: one on a news story from the LA Times, one on a news release from Johns Hopkins, and this review on the release from NYU. And the core issues involved are similar across all three items. Cancer is a widespread health problem that affects many millions of Americans. According to the National Cancer Institute, just under 1.7 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2016 alone. If you consider that each of those people has a family and loved ones who are also affected by the diagnosis, you can begin to appreciate the scope of the problem. According to a report from the National Institutes of Health’s 2002 State-of-the-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain, Depression, and Fatigue, “The clinical ‘rule of thumb’ is that 25 percent of cancer patients are likely depressed enough at some point in the course of disease to warrant evaluation and treatment.” This makes it especially important for research institutions and news outlets to write responsibly about studies like those discussed in this release.

250,250,Talk Therapy Found to Ease Schizophrenia,"The story says drug doses were 20-50% lower, which is a very big deal considering the side effects of these drugs. Overall, however, we think the description of the evidence is sufficient to warrant a Satisfactory rating. So while we can’t give credit here, we won’t ding the story either. It says patients in the therapy group, who received more one-on-one talk therapy and family counseling “made greater strides in recovery over the first two years of treatment than patients who got the usual drug-focused care.” But nowhere in the story does it tell us how “strides” were measured or give us a percentage by which they exceeded those for the control group. We’ll rate it Not Applicable.",true,"Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. “Though it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,” the correction notes.”Therefore, the study did not conclude ‘that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.’ (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes. )” We changed the headline of our review from “Times captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment” to “Times explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.” The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers. In a large randomized controlled trial in 34 community clinics across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better. The story overall does a solid job of covering the study and its implications. But we wish it had pushed a bit harder to quantify the benefits shown in the 2-year trial with some hard numbers. We applaud the discussion of federal policy and financing, but also wish there had been some discussion of the costs of therapy itself. The inclusion of a variety of perspectives on the research brings depth and nuance to the coverage. Psychiatric treatment in the U.S. has become very drug focused. Other countries are ahead of us on using more integrated care models like the one described in this story, so it’s great to see its success “proven” with a randomized trial. With solid evidence to back it, this model will hopefully become a more accepted approach to practice in the U.S."

They reinforce the idea that there are “quick fixes” to preventing a disease as implacable as cancer. They contribute to the confusing mix of health messages that cause consumers to tune out in frustration. They make it harder to reach readers with potentially useful, evidence-based information that could improve health."

257,257,"Robotic surgery grows, but so do questions",The story allowed the manufacturer to have its say and then countered each claim with a Johns Hopkins surgeon’s evaluation of the evidence. No disease mongering here. The story raises many questions about claims of benefits from robotic surgery. The growing use of robotic surgery – despite questions about the evidence – is the focus of the story. It also cited one study showing that people who had an adrenal gland removed by robot were more likely to have complications.,true,"It’s a rare story that counters all of the claims made for robotic surgery. This story scores so well because, one by one, it addresses our criteria in a way we expect stories about new technologies to analyze claims.

It would be nice to hear from researchers of the Women’s Health Initiative, or other clinicians who could discuss treatment options for women considering HRT. Yet there is no mention of absolute risk.",mixture,"The focus of this story is a report of new data showing a statistically significant association between lobular breast cancer and short-term HRT (3 years or less). The story creates an exaggerated sense of risk because there is no mention of absolute risk. For breast cancer, estimated excess risk is 8 women/10,000 women per year developing breast cancer after 4 years of combined HRT use as compared with no hormone use. A current treatment approach for bothersome menopausal symptoms is a course of low-dose HRT for 3-5 years with frequent monitoring. This course of treatment is considered safe for most women not already at high risk of developing breast cancer. The clinician interviewed stresses frequent monitoring and an individualized approach to managing symptoms. The story notes various combinations of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  available for reducing menopaual symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. However, there is no discussion that menopause is a natural part of aging and unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness and discomfort. The story does strike a balance by interviewing the lead author of the study and a gynecologist who put the new information in clinical perspective. It would be helpful to hear from researchers of the Women’s Health Initiative for comment on how their data on breast cancer risk compared to the present study."

Progesterone may be key to preventing recurrent miscarriage is the inventor of a patent related to the monitoring of endometrial glandular development.” Are there alternative methods to determine the health of a fetus and other potential treatments to prevent miscarriage? There is no obvious use of unjustified language, but the last paragraph contains some somewhat intemperate language from one of the co-investigators who said: “We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss.” Beneficial? We don’t have any idea after reading this news release.",false,"This is a somewhat confusing news release that contained very few of the most important details from the study — effectiveness, safety and cost, for example — that anyone would want to know if they were interested in preventing miscarriage. The confusion arises around what is being tested: is it the progesterone, the nCyclinE molecular marker or the Endometrial Function Test (EFT) used in this experiment to identify a subset of women who would benefit from progesterone? Our reviewers were baffled and readers likely will be, too. Progesterone has been clinically used to prevent unexplained early miscarriage. Some early meta-analyses had suggested a reduction in miscarriages, but later trials showed no difference. If you are going to make a claim that progesterone prevents miscarriage, you should have more than a 116-person study to back up that claim. Preventing miscarriages could be a major public health advance and have a very profound effect on the lives of parents and families. If a cheap, safe and effective treatment could be prescribed to prevent untimely deaths of fetuses that would be welcome news. Potential mothers who have experienced the pain of miscarriage, however, should not be inadvertently led astray from headlines that promise miscarriage prevention without adequate study of the safety and effectiveness of that treatment.

264,264,Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients.,"When the 2007 National Toxicology Program study was published, the state of California was given their first legal rationale to include 4-MEI in the Proposition 65 list, because the National Toxicology Program is one of the organizations the act defines as a valid arbiter of carcinogenicity. Is 4-Methylimidazole a Carcinogen? In 2011, the EFSA re-evaluated 4-MEI and other byproducts of caramel color processing, finding that the levels Europeans were exposed to through food consumption were far lower than those that would raise any plausible carcinogenicity concerns. Clickbait websites have aggregated that story and ensured its continued virality by sharing it on highly followed Facebook accounts such as “March Against Monsanto.” The 2016 Natural News article documented the Center for Environmental Health’s effort to uncover levels of a chemical called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products that were higher than the legal limits imposed by the state of California’s Proposition 65.

The release provides adequate data for readers to trust its claims but doesn’t mention funding sources or address whether there was any potential for conflicts of interest. To its credit, however, the release includes a basic research abstract providing more detailed information on the results from the trials. Tuberculosis is a serious problem worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) has a stated goal of controlling, if not eradicating, the disease by 2035. As is noted, the most often used test (TST) is associated with a high false positive rate making inappropriate treatment more likely.

It would be more than worthwhile to include a few additional sentences articulating what the scores are, what the relevant numerical benefits were, and why the researchers deemed the changes in these scores to be important. It’s problematic to make a mistake on a point as basic as this one. We’ll rate this Not Applicable.",false,"The news release focuses on a small-scale study comparing the outcomes of osteochondral allograft transplantation — a technique that replaces damaged knee cartilage with healthy cartilage from a donor. The researchers used the technique to treat knee pain in two groups of patients: those over the age of forty and those under the age of forty. Specifically, the release reports that osteochondral allograft transplantation — sometimes in conjunction with additional surgery — can be an effective treatment for older adults. However, the release offers little detailed information. For example, it fails to address costs, potential harms, or quantified benefits related to the procedure. It also didn’t explain that the control group used in the study wasn’t really adequate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. Knee pain is a common complaint that increases with age. In older individuals, symptoms are often related to arthritis due to “wear and tear” over time. Problems with the cartilage that covers the bone are thought to be a common factor that contributes to these arthritic changes. If the cartilage is lost in certain places, the result is bone on bone irritation without the protective surface that the cartilage provides. There are many causes for developing cartilage defects, but one is prior knee surgery, commonly arthroscopic (“scope”) procedures done to repair tears in the pad (meniscus) that cushion the knee bones. That is why most patients in this study had a history of prior surgery. Treatment for cartilage damage has focused on ways to regrow it so that the defects can be repaired. This study reports on one such procedure. The key issue evaluated here is the age of the patient. This is important because with increasing age the cartilage problems get worse and don’t respond to repair attempts. So studies demonstrating similar benefit in older compared to younger patients may be important. But it is also important to know that even in younger patients, such techniques haven’t been shown in high quality studies to really work, especially in longer-term follow-up studies. Thus saying that outcomes were similar in younger and older patients may mislead readers by overlooking the generally limited evidence of success, especially over time, in younger patients."

The review lends more evidence to the theory that some allergies can be avoided, paradoxically, by exposing children earlier to the allergen, such as peanuts or eggs. But this is not the final word, and the researchers make that clear in their review, stating, “these systematic review findings should not automatically lead to new recommendations to feed egg and peanut to all infants.” This viewpoint is missing from the TIME story, which headlined this story with a very conclusive statement: “Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies.”   Food allergies are common and on the rise in the U.S. Parents deserve more context and some of the caveats behind why the researchers caution against a blanket recommendation."

Although the price for Xarelto has not been set in the US, a quick check of the price in Canadian pharmacies could have been done easily. The cost to the consumer in Canada is about $9 a day as compared to about $0.50 a day for brand name Coumadin.",true,"The story is based on a preliminary report presented at a scientific meeting. The results of the study in question have not been analyzed completely and have not been subjected to peer review. Although the study results appear to be good news, we really won’t know until the entire study is published. Sometimes journalists on deadline at a scientific conference with hundreds and hundreds of papers being presented may forget to remind readers that there are limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from talks presented at meetings because they have not been published, the full data have not been released, and the work has not undergone the kind of full review that a journal would employ before publishing. These are all important caveats"
312,312,Blood-Pressure Drugs Linked to Birth Defects,The article referred to the original retrospective study and where it could be found (New England Journal of Medicine). There was no cost comparison for ACE inhibitors and the other medications that might be used in the management of hypertension. The story discussed the impact of pregnancy on blood pressure – lowering it for some women and raising it in others. Blood-Pressure Drugs Linked to Birth Defects The harms to the fetus of treating a mother with an ACE inhibitor during the first trimester of pregnancy are plainly mentioned.,true,"This article reports recent research results that indicate that the use of popular high blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors may, during the first trimester of pregnancy, increase the rate of birth defects from 2.6 per 100 to 7.1 per 100. Although ACE inhibitors have been used for 25 years, the potential risk to human fetuses during the first third of pregnancy had not been explicitly studied. The article would have been improved if it had included the fact that there may also be risks associated with not using ACE inhibitors for some women, such as those with congestive heart failure or diabetes. Overall, this story was very well written and reported."
313,313,Pushing Limits of New Knees,"Younger patients might expect similar short-term outcomes but their long-term outcomes would be less predictable. The article included comments from several independent sources. The article discussed the expanding indications for knee and hip replacement. It was not clear, however, whether any of the expert sources had conflicts of interest with implant manufacturers. Detailing the complications and adverse events that can be expected in revision procedures would have helped balance the article.",mixture,"This article looked at this issue through the positive short-term experiences of six individuals who opted for joint replacement in mid-life. They all seemed to be exuberantly active and have splendid outcomes after emerging from post-operative rehabilitation. The six recipients of artificial knees and hips were collectively able to engage in long-distance cycling, kite-boarding, motorcycling, yoga, pilates, strength training and basketball. One woman reported that her pain and limitations were completely gone. “I never imagined my life could be so wonderful,” she commented. Although several of the subjects were pushing the envelope in terms of stressing their implanted joints with high-impact activities, not a single one reported a problem, a complication, or a functional limitation when they returned to normal activity. In a country where more than half of adults are overweight, and almost half are completely sedentary, the joint replacement patients in the Wall St. Journal article are far from the norm. It is hard to imagine that these six individuals are representative of patients who opt for joint replacement in middle age across the United States. The story did attempt to balance the idealized view of joint replacement in the patient vignettes with cautionary notes from several surgeons. These invited experts pointed out that artificial joint recipients should avoid high-impact sports and that the durability of joints implanted in mid-life remains uncertain. Given the views of these experts, some tough questioning of the patients could have shown the reader that these individuals may be experiencing short-term benefits at the expense of long-term misery—if their implants ultimately fail. More references to scientific studies would have been welcome. The article never reported the overall success rate of knee and hip replacement in younger patients. Or the degree to which these procedures lead to an increased level of activity. It gave short shrift to one of the key questions about joint replacement in middle-age. In terms of pain, function, and adverse advents, what are the projected outcomes of the revision procedures that appear to be inevitable for surgeries performed at this age? And the article never got into the thorny question as to whether the surge in knee and hip replacement in younger patients might represent over-utilization of these surgical procedures—or at least premature use. A recent commentary in Arthritis Care & Research suggested that patients and their doctors in the United States rely excessively on analgesics and joint replacement to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and hip—and are under-utilizing evidence-based treatments, such as weight loss and exercise programs, that might delay these operations. (See Hunter et al., 2011). Reference: Hunter DJ et al., Quality of osteoarthritis management and the need for reform in the U.S., Arthritis Care & Research, 2011; 63(1): 31-38. Although knee and hip replacement have traditionally been employed in patients 65 and older, there has been a recent expansion in their utilization in younger patients, particularly those in their 40s and 50s. Since patients this age will likely require one or more revision procedures over the course of their lifetimes, this creates uncertainty about the long-term outcomes of knee and hip replacement in this population. There is also evidence that healthcare practitioners in the United States are not following evidence-based guidelines in the treatment of painful osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, particularly in its early stages. As a result, some patients may be undergoing joint replacement unnecessarily. (See Hunter et al., 2011). Given the “graying” of the general population, and the rising prevalence of painful OA, these are huge public health issues. The aging of the population means that society will have trouble paying for these procedures in older individuals. Paying for expanded use in large numbers of younger patients who will then face more expensive reoperations later in life is a daunting prospect."

315,315,Jury Still Out on Radiation for Early Prostate Cancer,"Within a story that discusses the lack of evidence, cost certainly deserved more attention. The story made clear that this is one in a series of federally funded studies on prostate cancer treatment options. The story did state: “Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.”  We wish it had provided more detail, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt. Proton beam therapy and a related approach – intensity modulated radiation therapy – are being used more commonly and both are very expensive. The entire story was about a systematic review of studies comparing different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy – and whether any has been shown to be a better option than “watchful waiting.” Not applicable.",true,This 750 word story provided readers with a good synopsis of the study results and did so in plain and straightforward terms providing definitions for the average reader. We liked the fact that the story linked the study results to a reasonable set of recommendations for men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer. News stories in recent years have so often breathlesslly promoted new radiation therapy approaches such as proton beam therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy. It is important to bring the public reviews of the evidence that show “currently available evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of radiation treatments for localized prostate cancer compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.”

320,320,Gabapentin is now considered the most dangerous drug in America and will surpass opioids as the largest prescription drug killer.,"(There has since been at least one other gabapentin overdose reported in the absence of other drugs). A 62-year-old woman’s suicide, reported in a 2011 case study, claimed to be the first published report of a gabapentin overdose in combination with no other drugs — an outcome that confounded researchers. The pharmacological and medical community have long considered the drug safe with few adverse effects. On 28 June 2017, Kaiser Health News reported on an apparent increase in abuse of gabapentin (brand name Neurontin) in Ohio and across the nation in a story that saw wide syndication in USA Today, STAT News, and many other outlets: Last December, Ohio’s Board of Pharmacy began reporting sales of gabapentin prescriptions in its regular monitoring of controlled substances. That story (“There Is More Than One Opioid Crisis”) indicated that 32.6 percent of all people who overdosed in Kentucky in 2016 had the presence of gabapentin in their system under autopsy, and that it was the most common drug found in some specific demographics: According to the findings, gabapentin […] was the drug most frequently detected in women who had died from drug overdoses and among victims over the age of 44.",false,"While the increasing prevalence of gabapentin abuse is an important finding and a vital step in understanding the complexities of the opioid epidemic, it is not a finding that should cause legitimate users alarm. To suggest that a drug which millions of people depend on is deadly and should be avoided at all costs, as the viral Facebook post suggested, is wholly irresponsible. Its potential for abuse was underestimated, but nobody is arguing that it is now more likely to cause death through an overdose on its own. As such, we rank this claim as false."

Various prescription treatments are on the market designed to increase bone mineral density and either prevent fractures in the first place or reduce the risk of a subsequent one. Exercise, diet and lifestyle also are involved in risk factor prevention and modification, and all of the prescription drugs carry risks for some women of serious side effects, including higher than usual risks for a rare form of bone cancer, kidney stones, weakness, respiratory infections, and dizziness.

The story mentioned that the dietary intervention did not have any impact in terms of weight loss or improving blood sugar levels.

The drug certainly faces a very long and uncertain road before it might be approved for use in actual cancer patients — something the release never warned readers about. This is interesting research that’s worth writing about, but the release desperately needed a statement cluing readers in to the very preliminary nature of the study. Millions of people with cancer are hoping for new therapies, and this release could set them up for false hope. The release promises that FY26 could be “cheaper to produce, less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinum-based drugs.” The release does not say that results from lab work will need to be tested for years before the therapy is proven safe and effective."

332,332,New heart attack test could identify two-thirds of patients at very low risk of heart attack in the emergency department,Further work would be needed to assess the relative downstream costs associated with this new test. The release does a pretty good job of comparing current troponin tests with more sensitive one used for the current study. Other factors that are likely to be important that could have been mentioned from the paper include changes in the EKG (electrical test of the heart) that is also part of standard care. No disease mongering here; the accurate diagnosis of heart attack is a serious issue. The potential harms of this test — discharging a patient who may be having a heart attack and be at risk of dying — can only be adequately assessed in prospective evaluations using this new test as part of routine care.,mixture,"This news release describes the results of a study designed to significantly advance the search for a rapid blood test that can rule out evidence of heart muscle damage in people who come to emergency rooms with chest pain and other symptoms of heart attack. The study, reported in the journal The Lancet, specifically offers compelling evidence that a version of a commonly used blood test may indeed further that quest. For the study, investigators used a highly sensitive version of an existing blood test that detects the protein troponin on more than 6,300 consecutive people presenting to hospital emergency rooms (mostly in Scotland) with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The researchers were able to determine the probability that patients were NOT at risk of heart attack or death from heart attack after 30 days for a range of troponin levels. The release does a generally adequate job of describing how the high-sensitivity test appears to identify very low levels of troponin, in contrast to current troponin tests, thus making it theoretically possible to accurately, relatively quickly, and safely rule out a heart attack in more than 60 percent of such people, at least over the short term. It covers the fact that conventional troponin testing detects only higher levels of the protein, and must be done on serial blood samples over a longer period of time. And the news release puts appropriate emphasis on the potential the new test has for decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations and reducing health care costs. All that said, the release could have done a much better job of making clear earlier in the text that substantially more research will be needed to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of relying heavily on high-sensitivity troponin testing. Although the release uses qualifiers such as “may have been eligible for early safe discharge,” we think more needed to be said about potential risks, about the potential costs of the more sensitive test; and most of all about the limitations of the study and over-reliance on any single test when people experience heart attack symptoms. Patients arriving at emergency facilities with chest pain is a common and costly situation that is associated with potentially devastating consequences when the evaluation isn’t done in a thorough fashion. The current evaluation of chest pain involves a history focused on the patient’s reported symptoms and past history of heart disease and risk factors as well as tests performed. These include an electrical test of the heart (EKG or electrocardiogram) and blood tests looking for damage to heart muscle. This evaluation has been standard for decades, but better blood tests over time have allowed emergency providers to more accurately and quickly identify patients who may be having a heart attack. At the same time, the use of these newer tests has permitted providers to more quickly identify those who are not having a heart attack, allowing for earlier discharge from the emergency facility or hospital. The study reported in this news release seeks to define the threshold below which a new, more sensitive test identifies people who are at low risk for heart attack or heart related death over the next 30 days. If confirmed, this will be a positive step forward in effectively and efficiently evaluating patients with chest pain in emergency facilities. However, the main limitation of this study is that it is using information previously collected to predict what would have happened if this new test and threshold was used. Only with prospective use and evaluation can we actually determine if this new test and threshold, when applied as part of routine care, leads to improved care and more efficient use of emergency and hospital resources."

The primary outcome the researchers sought to measure — startle response — was never really described.",false,"This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the enzymes. The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is. The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn’t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur. The search for the neurochemical and biological roots of PTSD and other kinds of crippling anxieties is a scientific challenge for good reason. The human “mind” is difficult to access; animal models are notoriously unreliable; and experiments on people designed to induce, evoke, or otherwise probe such trauma may be unethical. The work described here may indeed be an important early step in understanding the role of signaling pathways outside of nerve cells in creating PTSD, and of novel strategies using an already widely available set of drugs to sabotage that role. But a lot more research will be needed to affirm the idea and a release on the research should make that point very clear and very high up in the text. When and if the blocking of a conditioned fear response by a drug is proven, who would want to take a long term drug in case a terrible event befalls them in the future? That would be taking “preventive medicine” to a whole new level."

We don’t think it’s adequate to say, “The cognitive effects of proton therapy – primarily affecting verbal comprehension and processing speed – were also less serious than what has been reported with photon radiotherapy, and those effects were primarily seen in children who were under the age of 8 when treated.” There is no disease mongering in the release. We’ve previously described some of the issues with costs in other reviews and blog posts focusing on proton therapy.",mixture,"This news release summarizes findings from an observational study that looks at the long-term side effects of treating childhood brain tumors with proton radiotherapy compared with the more standard photon therapy. The premise of the study and its follow-up release is that proton beam therapy, by damaging less normal brain tissue, leaves a young patent with fewer long-term future complications from side effects. The study, published in Lancet Oncology, reports on the follow-up of 59 children treated at one institution with proton beam therapy between 2003 and 2009. The release imparts a lot of information about the complicated study in a brief, readable way, but we have several concerns with missing information and implied results. All of the patients in the study had additional treatments including surgery and chemotherapy, so the benefits and harms cannot be fully attributed to the proton beam therapy. The release also does not address costs (which are significantly higher than standard therapy) or a very important limitation explained in the study which is that, for ethical reasons, there is no randomized control group treated in a similar way except for receiving conventional radiation therapy. Treating cancer at any age is a challenging task for doctors, but when it involves children the stakes can’t be higher. This is particularly the case when the cancer is in a sensitive location, in this case the child’s brain, and when it can be life threatening, such as medulloblastoma. The treatments need to be strong enough to provide long-term management and at the same time spare normal surrounding tissue. When that surrounding tissue is the brain of a young child, damage can lead to life-long, serious complications. Studies that purport to offer improved outcomes need attention and scrutiny."

The same critique goes on to say, “One of its central themes, for example, is Disney’s fascination with cryogenesis and the strong suggestion that his body was frozen following his death. The exact origins of the rumor are unknown, but at least one Disney publicist has suggested that the story was started by a group of Disney Studio animators who “had a bizarre sense of humor.” The earliest known printed version of the rumor appeared in the magazine Ici Paris in 1969.

As this story points out, there are many factors which can make it difficult for patients to take cholesterol-lowering statin medication. Some patients are troubled by statin-related muscle pain, while others simply aren’t disciplined enough to take their daily dose of medicine as directed. Other patients may never achieve their target for LDL cholesterol reduction despite taking the highest available statin dose.

In areas of the star where the magnetic fields are particularly strong — thus restricting some heat from the sun’s core from reaching its surface — dark spots appear, or what astronomers call sunspots.",false,"What's true: Solar activity, which is often defined by the amount of sunspots on the star's surface, pendulates on a roughly 11-year cycle. The most recent cycle, which began in late 2008, peaked with sunspots in April 2014 and then steadily decreased until reaching a ""solar minimum"" — or a period with zero sunspots — in late 2019 and 2020. That means, yes, by spring 2020, solar activity had reached a so-called ""lockdown,"" or solar minimum. What's false: While the sun had entered a so-called ""lockdown"" period — when the number of sunspots on the star's surface decreased to few or none, technically called a ""solar minimum"" — by spring 2020, it was a normal occurrence for the star and was not projected by scientists to threaten life on Earth with famine, earthquakes, or freezing weather."

401,401,Fewer mammograms means more breast cancer deaths,"Instead, the broadcast spreads fear. (See “Harms of Treatment” below) The news story quotes one expert who asserts that less screening will mean more cancer deaths. That benefit is just assumed, leading to a concurrent assumption about the impact of fewer mammography centers. Two independent sources were quoted. But when?",false,"This broadcast describes data from two recent government reports showing that fewer women are undergoing mammograms and fewer mammography centers are in business today than a few years ago. It quotes one expert who says this means that more women will therefore die of breast cancer. Few would argue that all women should have access to mammography. However, the broadcast provides no evidence to support the dire conclusion of the expert that more deaths will ensue. It also fails to balance this view with information about the potential harms of mammography. And it neglects to note that the GAO report says that current capacity is “likely adequate.”  What is the quality of evidence on this complex topic? There is no way to tell from the broadcast whether the scientific evidence supports the view that fewer mammograms will categorically result in more cancer deaths, nor any attempt to weigh this against the evidence that mammography may produce harms as well as benefits. Most experts believe that mammography in women aged 50 to 69 saves lives; its benefit in those younger and older is controversial. But like other cancer screens, improved survival among women who undergo mammography may be deceiving. It is possible, for example, that screened patients do not actually live longer than unscreened patients do, but simply appear to live longer because they receive a diagnosis earlier. It is also possible that mammography will actually cause harm. Exposure to radiation during mammography could itself cause breast cancer 10 or 20 years down the road. (Br J Cancer 2005;93:590-6. Lancet 2000;355:1757-70) In addition, mammograms increase the diagnosis of lesions. Left untreated, some of these will become cancers, but many will not. The discovery of a lesion leads not only to fear and anxiety, but also to invasive diagnostic tests and invasive treatments (including mastectomy or lumpectomy) that inflict additional emotional and physical harm. “For every woman who has her life extended by screening,” writes the Cochrane Center’s Peter Gotzsche in Denmark, “there are at least five women who will be diagnosed with, and treated for, cancer unnecessarily.” (Lancet 2005;366;1519-20) One learns nothing about these potential harms in the ABC News broadcast. Because medicine does not yet have perfect estimates of the harms of mammography, some would say there is no simple “right” recommendation for every patient. The only possible blanket recommendation might be for clinicians–and the news media–to explain the potential benefits and harms, and thus help women to evaluate their own individual tolerance for risk and preferences so that they can choose the course of action that best suits them. News organizations that choose to cover medicine should explain the quality of the evidence and the pros and cons surrounding any medical procedure well enough for patients to understand what is known and what remains unknown. Unfortunately, instead of an even-handed analysis, this broadcast promotes fear."

While the release makes the claim that the study “demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness,” it was an observational study which cannot show cause-and-effect. The release notes that this intervention is a subject of debate among experts, and that more studies are needed to confirm the long term efficacy and safety of this approach. It falls short in several areas: it neglects to mention that the FDA warns against using lasers for menopause symptoms, excludes any data from the study, and omits disclosure of significant financial conflicts of interest among study authors and the organization that distributed the release, the North American Menopause Society. It’s estimated that around half of post-menopausal women have at least one of the aforementioned constellation of symptoms that some doctors label “genitourinary symptoms of menopause,” or GSM, and others see as normal (but problematic) symptoms of a low estrogen state. Some women respond well to symptomatic treatment, others may choose hormone replacement, and some struggle to find relief. It’s important to point out that many women seek no treatment at all. For women interested in treatment, finding reliable information can be problematic. Thorough and thoughtful news releases and news coverage should, at the very least, provide:  good data balancing the benefits and potential harms, give a sense of safety and efficacy in comparison to other existing treatments, seek out independent experts not involved in the highlighted study, as well as fully disclose if that study could be biased by conflicts of interest."

This story says nothing about this.",true,"This story in STAT, like the one in TIME.com that we also reviewed, describes the successful, and apparently first positive response of a glioblastoma brain tumor to CAR-T therapy. This is an experimental immunotherapy that depends on on injections of modified immune cell proteins and that has had a few successes in blood cancers but essentially none in solid tumors, including those in the brain. Described in a report in the The New England Journal of Medicine, the study was conducted and promoted by officials and physicians at the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center, an organization that has a somewhat unfortunate history of touting treatments as bringing about “miracles” and encouraging coverage of compelling individual cancer patient stories to support sometimes exaggerated claims of major advances in cancer treatment. This STAT story does a better job than TIME of putting what is essentially a single, unexpected experimental result into perspective. Its strongest points are that it avoids touting this one patient’s experience as any kind of broad “success,” calling it an “early inroad;’ emphasizing its “notorious” potential side effects; and most of all quoting sources outside City of Hope who made clear that, as one put it, the success was possibly a “flash in the pan.” Bravo. One thing that would have made the story stronger? Early on emphasizing how a single case study makes for weak evidence. See our six tips for writing accurately about cancer immunotherapy drugs. Unlike the TIME story (see our review), this story included important voices of caution to help keep expectations in check. Starting with the headline, readers of this story are likely to come away with a more realistic perspective on this treatment.

Scientists having a financial stake in study is not uncommon, and doesn’t necessarily weaken a study’s results, but it should serve as a red flag to journalists to seek more outside expert opinions than normal. For example, while ovarian cancer is more lethal, it’s also more rare. The article also does a nice job showing how layer-caking genetic tests on other tissues (inner uterus and blood) can nearly double the detection rate of ovarian cancer, from 33% (Pap-smear genetic test) to 63% (a full PapSeek test), and improve endometrial cancer detection from 81% to 93%.

The test aims to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers, which typically aren’t found until they’re advanced, limiting effective treatments options and contributing to the lethality. The story takes care to note the shortfalls of the alternatives, and how an effective early-detection screening could help thousands of women per year in the US alone. However, the story falters in very important ways. There’s no mention that 27% of the study’s authors could benefit financially from the administration and sale of PapSeek tests, doesn’t appear to incorporate independent experts’ perspectives on the study and its significance, and skips over any discussion of costs or potential harms. Pap smears have slashed cervical cancer death rates by more than 60% since their inception in 1955, bringing the death rate to about 4,000 American women per year. But endometrial cancers kill roughly 10,000 women and ovarian cancer nearly 14,000 women per year — and there’s no widely accepted or effective screening method for early detection. This is especially important for ovarian cancer, as the lack of screening options have meant the numbers haven’t nudged much. Even if a screening test is not as sensitive as direct biopsies of cancerous tissues, any test at all for endometrial or ovarian cancers may catch more cases earlier, help patients begin treatment sooner, and see longer remissions and lifespan."

RHA would repeal that standard and exchange it for a “health” exception, broadly interpreted by courts to include age, economic, social and emotional factors, rather than the biological definition of “health” that normally comes to mind. The state of New York has passed a bill legalizing abortion up to birth. The RHA states that “A health care practitioner, acting within his or her lawful scope of practice, may perform an abortion when, according to the practitioner’s reasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient’s case: the patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.” Pro-life critics contended that provision would essentially “authorize abortion up until the moment of birth” because its health exception might be broadly interpreted beyond just issues of physical health:  Currently, late term unborn children are protected in New York State law after 24 weeks except to save a mother’s life. Pro-choice advocates, on the other hand, contended that such assertions were based on unrealistic, extreme interpretations of the law:  This is only true if you do not trust medical professionals to make informed, professional decisions for which they have been extensively trained and licensed, in consultation with the women in their care.",mixture,What's true: The New York state legislature passed a law allowing abortions after 24 weeks if the mother's health is at risk or there is an absence of fetal viability.

In that respect this is a very thoroughly reported story. However, the story implies the results may be relevant to the general population even though the people included in the study have a risk of syphilis, for example, that is more then 1,000 times higher than the general population. All men in the study were also taking antiviral prophylaxis against HIV infection. Much of our concern about the story stems from the overly broad headline, and we’re the first to acknowledge that reporters often have little control over that key aspect of their work. Nevertheless, we think it’s something that needs to be addressed if readers are to receive an accurate picture of the research and its relevance. This is an important topic because rates of sexually transmitted infections remain high, especially among high-risk populations, and a safe and effective means of preventing them would be big news. News stories such as this, however, should be very clear about the potential relevance of studies to general readers. A more complete description of the study population (and of the long history of other studies that have looked at using antibiotics to prevent sexually transmitted diseases) would have helped readers understand just how specific and limited the results of this study are."

There is no attempt to discuss the finding of the WHI with researchers in women’s health not affiliated with the study. There were about 12 extra cases of dementia in every 10,000 women using estrogen alone each year. It is clear that HRT is not proven to prevent heart disease or cancer. Also, there is no mention that the study found a slight increased risk of dementia in the estrogen-alone group.",false,"This story provides a brief overview of the results of the Estrogen-Alone study, which was a large, randomized, blinded trial and part of the Women’s Health Initiative study of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The story accurately notes that estrogen-alone therapy is only for postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. The story provides some balance on the risks and benefits of taking estrogen alone to relieve symptoms of menopause, and there is caution that it is not right for certain women. There is discussion of some of the established benefits of HRT, such as relieving hot flashes and helping to prevent osteoporosis. However, there is no quantitative data from the study on how great a benefit HRT would provide. For example, in the estrogen alone study, there were only 6 fewer hip fractures (11 cases in estrogen alone and 17 cases in placebo group) out of tens of thousands of women enrolled. There is no discussion of other medications which are effectively used to prevent osteoporosis and have fewer health risks. The most erroneous portion of the story is the claim that “women can take this form of HRT with worrying about breast cancer.” It is true that there were fewer cases of breast cancer in the estrogen alone group: 28 per 10,000 in the estrogen group vs. 34 per 10,000 in the placebo group, and the difference was not statistically significant. However, there were more abnormal mammograms that required follow-up and 33% more breast biopsies in the estrogen alone group (747 vs. 549), which does not necessarily mean more breast cancer, but can signal changes in breast cells and tissue. Also, women at a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the estrogen-alone group had larger tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, which can mean a poorer prognosis and more breast cancer treatment. Lastly, there is no discussion that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a condition which necessitates medical intervention. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take hormone therapy medications to ease symptoms common in menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal dryness and discomfort. The report does not talk about less invasive alternative treatments for relieving symptoms of menopause such as exercise, vaginal creams, and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats."

More sustained levels of dopamine may help with cravings and withdrawal from nicotine. The studies discussed were both funded by Pfizer and reports of side effects were limited, as only nausea was listed and qualified as “mild” by the primary researcher. Despite the headline (“Drug effective in smoking cessation studies”), which we know is usually not written by the reporter, the journalists are appropriately cautious about the findings and provide information about the funding source and potential conflicts of interest. Abstinence rates at one year for each smoking cessation drug and placebo are presented; however, the news story lacks a comparison with abstinence rates for alternative (non-drug) methods of smoking cessation and does not provide enough information about the long-term risks of the newer drug or side effects. Longer-term data, larger controlled studies and more information on the safety of varenicline (vs. the more studied bupropion) are necessary before this drug is presented as a viable option for smoking cessation. Given that the drug has not yet been approved for smoking cessation in the U.S., the storyâ€™s generally positive tone fails to remind readers of hurdles still to be passed on the road to approval.

The story states the total number of patients (18), their age range (average age was 61), but it’s missing hard information about the range of specific improvements, along with any interviews from researchers independent of this study or medical center. An estimated 800,000 people in the U.S. experience an ischemic stroke each year, and most of them have permanent motor deficits unless treated with drugs within a few hours of the stroke.

Renewable resource advocates also agreed that the Recovery Act contributed to that growth. Obama didn’t mention, however, that so-called ""clean energy"" still accounts for a sliver of U.S. energy production, which overwhelmingly relies on fossil fuels. Nor does it include other kinds of renewable energy, such as biomass and hydroelectric, which have remained relatively flat."

Although it quotes from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial, the CBS story doesn’t feature any critical perspectives on the study. We would have liked a closer look at some of the study’s shortcomings, which could have been achieved by comments from an independent source, or someone who was not involved in the study. More context on where this study fits in “the growing body of evidence” would have also been welcome. Finally, word choice could have been better. CBS refers to the JAMA editorial and writes that “the study’s findings are significant.” However, “statistically significant” has a different meaning than what the public believes is “significant.” The distinction should be clear, or another word should be used. Childhood obesity is a health concern that is on the minds of many parents and policymakers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. In 2012, more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese, the CDC said. And compared to other countries around the world, the US comes out on top when it comes to obesity among adults, according to a 2014 OECD report. There are even speculations that high obesity rates may cause life expectancy in the US to decline.

It’s not enough to state only that there was no difference. Although preventing disability in stroke patients will clearly save health care dollars, it’s also possible that the additional costs of imaging to identify patients eligible for clot removal after six hours will add to health care costs. The release does an adequate job of comparing the randomized groups (late clot retrieval versus medication), although it could have offered much more information about how the study defined patients whose damaged brain area was considered “small” enough to qualify for late clot removal. The release doesn’t mention any specific harms from either approach, nor what the rate of adverse effects was in either group.",mixture,"This news release from Emory University describes  findings of a randomized clinical trial that showed  positive outcomes among almost half of stroke patients whose brain blood clots were removed well outside the time frame of six hours currently recommended by stroke experts. The release properly discloses that the study was funded by a company that makes the clot removing device and quotes investigators from one of the participant investigators not at Emory. The release could have been stronger had it disclosed details about the patients (such as age, and their co-occurring conditions, race, gender); the size of the population of stroke victims in the U.S. likely to benefit from “late” clot removal; and limitations of the study (e.g. follow up was for 90 days, not long term). Some details on which stroke victims are considered eligible for clot removal within six to 24 hours and the costs of the clot removal procedure itself would have been helpful. Disability from stroke is a major cause of suffering and high health care costs in the United States and elsewhere, and despite advances in technology (clot removal devices) and clot-busting drugs, its prevention has long depended on how fast a stroke patient can make it to a hospital for treatment. The six-hour window long thought to be the maximum time in which clot removal technologies could save brains and lives has meant that individuals unlucky enough to have a stroke in remote locations, or in bad weather, for example, stood little chance of enough recovery to lead independent lives. Thus, the results of rigorous studies like the one described in the release — it was stopped early because of the positive outcomes — are exceptionally newsworthy, and important for the public to know about."

Since this is the first time botulinum toxin has been tested in human hearts, it’s safe to say that it could be several years before it receives approval as a preventative for heart complications. The release does not use unjustifiable language. “But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.” The release satisfies this criterion but a few more details would have made the release even better.",true,"This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment."

Electro-acupuncture is not suggested for people with heart problems, strokes, seizures or epilepsy, nor should it be used by patients with cardiac pacemakers since the small current used can disrupt the function of these devices. The release does say that the research involved a “randomized, controlled trial,” which offers some detail, as does the fact that “58 breast cancer survivors” who experienced bothersome hot flashes participated. According to Johns Hopkins University, about 75 percent of all women going through menopause experience hot flashes, the most common symptom of menopause. The release makes no mention of potential harms or side effects from the use of electro-acupuncture, which like traditional acupuncture, is considered to be of relatively low risk.",false,"This short release reports on a small study looking at whether electro-acupuncture is effective in diminishing night-time hot flashes among breast cancer survivors, and therefore, improving the quality of their sleep. While it states that this therapeutic approach is as good as, or perhaps better, than a drug (gabapentin) often prescribed for hot flashes, the release offers no data showing the extent of improvement, nor are there mentions of the cost of such treatments, or of potential harms from using it which, while not enormous, are not negligible either. The release also neglects to identify any of the researchers involved in the trial. More and more people are surviving breast cancer and there is increasing interest among survivors and clinicians about quality of life for survivors. As the release states, perhaps 6 million patients may have survived by the year 2020, meaning even serious discomforts like hot flashes among such patients will become a growing problem.

517,517,Al Gore's residence uses considerably more energy than the average American home.,"And although I wish there was a qualifier (“up to”, “as much as”, “in one month”), it was based off of a legitimate number. The former vice president has installed solar panels, a rainwater-collection system and geothermal heating. I even rounded down to 21.3X in everything I wrote to be as fair and as bulletproof as possible — that’s why I went about so thoroughly discussing the makeup of the power he receives at his home and his donations to the Green Power Switch program, so there would be no confusion on those issues when it came to his power bill costs and his “100% renewable” claim.” I don’t believe the DC title intentionally misrepresented the report. “They also use compact fluorescent bulbs and other energy efficiency measures and then they purchase offsets for their carbon emissions to bring their carbon footprint down to zero.” Also, by the end of 2007 the Gores had completed renovations that made their home much more energy-efficient: Al Gore, who was criticized for high electric bills at his Tennessee mansion, has completed a host of improvements to make the home more energy efficient, and a building-industry group has praised the house as one of the nation’s most environmentally friendly. The vice president has done that, Kreider argues, and the family tries to offset that carbon footprint by purchasing their power through the local Green Power Switch program — electricity generated through renewable resources such as solar, wind, and methane gas, which create less waste and pollution.",mixture,"If one were to compare electricity consumption in Al Gore’s home in April (the month of lowest usage) to the national average, the multiplier drops from 34 to 10.

It is very likely that the TEPI system will cost the consumer much more. Is is important to be able to achieve the higher dosages discussed in this story?",mixture,"To begin with, the headline of this story is a little much: a “side-effect free future” with this patch? Surely, we can’t dispense entirely with oral ibuprofen even if this patch were to deliver everything it promises. And while it makes sense that transdermal delivery would reduce stomach-related side effects, do we really know if this approach will eliminate other possible side effects that aren’t related to the GI tract — for example related to cardiovascular risk? The advantages of the TEPI patch (this apparent acronym is never spelled out in the story) over existing products on the market sound impressive and believable — although very little evidence is given to help us assess the quality of these claims. The promise of transdermal drug delivery has been on the horizon for decades and the TEPI patch is the latest iteration. Ibuprofen and the other NSAID’s are safe and effective for the vast majority of people taking them. People with chronic conditions like osteoarthritis are at risk for side effects because of the relatively large doses taken orally. In theory, a patch could reduce the likelihood of these side effects but the proof is simply not there yet."

The article offers balance through two patient anecdotes. One patient says the genetic testing helped guide her to an effective antidepressant, while the other isn’t convinced. An outside expert is also tapped who points to specific treatments rather than genetic testing for higher chances of success. Although this article was cautious about the touted benefits, it would have served readers better by exploring some of the limitations of the research studies. The evidence doesn’t appear to come from gold-standard, randomized controlled trials. The only study we found through an online search was an abstract presented at a May 2018 medical conference. The majority of patients with major depression who choose antidepressant therapy do not achieve remission with the first medication they try. Even among those who do, many relapse. That’s why many patients end up frustrated — and still suffering with symptoms — as they endure a subsequent trial-and-error approach until an effective medication or combination of medications is found. One promise of precision medicine — that has yet to be proven — is that genetic testing may help guide this process and make it more “personalized” and efficient. It’s important to make it clear (as this article does) that these genetic tests cannot predict which medicines will work, and it’s arguable if they can even identify those that will not. Furthermore, because the financial stakes are high, it’s important for journalists to scrutinize (and be transparent) about the funding of studies on these genetic tests, potential conflicts of interest, and whether the results are expressed in more meaningful absolute terms, rather than more eye-catching (and potentially misleading) relative terms.

The trial randomized participants to either a series of exercise classes or to continuing their usual activities, so all it can say is that class participation appeared to offer benefits.

The discovery is the latest example of new tests being  developed that can help doctors decide how and when to treat  different manifestations of cancer. This test will help us determine  that,” said Robert Wilson, a bowel cancer specialist at The  James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough. In the two earliest of the four key stages of bowel cancer,  patients normally have an operation to remove their tumor but  are rarely given chemotherapy, since the toxic treatment can  cause more harm than good.",true,"Stem cell scientists have developed a  new and more accurate way of spotting aggressive forms of bowel  cancer, allowing for tailored treatment that should improve  patients’ chances of survival."

Yet the story presents this single study that involved not even a single human subject as one that promises to “stop many types of the disease in their tracks” and to allow doctors to use chemotherapy and radiotherapy “with no risk of the disease taking hold elsewhere.” This is exactly the kind of story that leaves readers feeling whipsawed when clinical trials in actual patients may prove disappointing down the road. Scientists have every right to get excited when they find a new gene or make some advance that they believe holds promise for combating a particular disease. It is up to journalists to rein them in with careful analysis of the evidence and hard questions. This story offers neither. To the families who lose half a billion people every year to cancer in the United States alone, this is the kind of false hope that may cause more harm than good."

One could easily come away from this release thinking that these researchers are the first to report psoriasis symptom reduction in those undergoing bariatric surgery (with resultant weight loss). No evidence of disease mongering here. Presumably patients who lost weight through non-surgical means would have also benefited from having their psoriasis symptoms reduced. The trade-offs in terms of risks of complications and required lifestyle changes after bariatric surgery are critical considerations for a patient hoping to reduce their psoriasis symptoms.,mixture,"This is a chart review study which shows that losing excess weight by undergoing bariatric surgery could lessen the pain and inflammation experienced by psoriasis sufferers. While the treatment sounds hopeful, important information about the other (overall) benefits of bariatric surgery, its risks, alternatives and costs, including costs of treating complications, were all missing from this news release. This news release comes from a poster presented at a national meeting, which has not yet undergone peer review. Many key elements were not well described or sufficiently highlighted. The fact that this research comes from observational data (chart review) is important since we cannot infer causation from this type of research, and it is possible that some other factor stemming from the surgery besides the weight loss (for example, changes in diet or absorption of key nutrients) was responsible for the remission in psoriasis symptoms, rather than the weight loss itself. Psoriasis affects millions of Americans, and many people with moderate to severe psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis in their lifetimes. If obesity contributes to the development of this painful condition, then weight loss methods such as bariatric surgery may reduce those symptoms. Psoriasis sufferers may have few options to treat what is a lifetime of inflammation and pain, so if safe and effective methods to reduce those symptoms are available, many people could benefit. However, it needs to be pointed out that bariatric surgery is indicated only for morbid obesity, and it is not clear whether other weight loss therapies would result in the same benefit."

The story detailed that individuals taking lorcaserin lost more weight in 12 weeks than did the individuals who were taking the placebo. There were no sources of information quoted that were independent of the study or the company developing the drug.

However the story did not provide any information about the magnitude of the difference between the groups, nor did it actually provide absolute quantitative information about the actual amount of weight lost.",false,"This was a story about a possible new medication in the pipeline that may enable people to lose weight. It did not include the information needed to understand the relative strength of the study reported about and did not quantify in absolute terms (number of pounds lost)  the benefit that might be attained with the use of this medication. It was an interesting piece in that it made an attempt to contrast this medication with one that was withdrawn from the market. However, in light of this comparison, the story should have explained something about the time frame of the current study, and how that compared with the period of time that was needed for the problems with the drug that was withdrawn from the market to be observed. It should have also mentioned that the current trials with the new medication specifically exclude people with type of heart issue that was seen to be problematic with the withdrawn drug. The bottom line is that while the company may be optimistic that this drug will not result in harms, there are not yet sufficient data available to determine whether this is the case. It would have been useful to readers had the story made this clear. Finally, this was a San Diego paper reporting on “mid-stage” trial results on a San Diego company’s product. It is doubtful that the paper would report on such results from another company in another location. Applying that “business news” approach to health care product news is often problematic. It gives local readers a skewed picture of the research landscape and may give undue weight to the local idea."

603,603,$300 to learn risk of prostate cancer,"The story included comments from experts in the field who were not connected to the study reported on. The real goal is to develop a means of distinguishing between indolent and deadly prostate cancer.

A couple of the quotes border on disease-mongering when discussing the prospect of earlier prostate cancer screening – even in men in their 30s.. However, the story attempted to provide some context with expert comment questioning the wisdom in this approach.",true,"On the whole, this is a well crafted story about a new genetic test that may provide men with advance knowledge about their potential to develop prostate cancer in the future. The story made it very clear that gaining this information is not without cost above and beyond the test. This new screen suffers from the same problem as the currently available methods of detecting prostate cancer, namely determining whether the cancer will be deadly or not. This is a critical piece of information because as the story points out – the treatments for prostate cancer are not without side effect. It will fall upon the men taking this test who have an indication of high risk to then make a determination of the course of action they want to pursue. It is important for them to recognize that at this point in time, we do not yet know whether aggressive treatment of early detected prostate cancer is effective. The story allowed the test’s promoters to have their say.

We have a lot of good data on the adverse effects of antidepressants, and the story could easily have brought in summary data from other studies, rather than relying simply on 8 week data from a relatively small number of women.",false,"While the benefits are clearly explained, the story failed to mention any possible harms, didn’t discuss the cost of the drug, and didn’t explain that there is uncertainty about how long the benefits may last. The story also didn’t put the results in context with hormone replacement, the main alternative for women with more bothersome symptoms. These deficits might have been addressed in comments from an independent expert, but the story didn’t seek out any external perspective on the findings. We need more treatment options for women with disruptive menopausal symptoms. Although hormone treatment is effective, many women are reluctant to take hormones because of the small increase in potentially serious adverse effects associated with their use. Emerging research suggests that antidepressants may be an alternate option, but the study discussed in this story found that Lexapro is only slightly more effective than a placebo for reducing hot flashes. In addition, use of antidepressants also may cause a variety of adverse effects which, while less serious than the risks of hormone therapy, can be troublesome enough to cause people to stop taking the medication. Stories should provide this full context to help women make the best possible choice about how to manage their symptoms."

Ostensibly, the device could be used to detect early signs of metastasis in various forms of cancer, and potentially could find use in cancer treatment. However, the device’s utility at this point appears to be largely hypothetical. The release indicates that no clinical trials have been done; offers no information on benefits (or health risks) associated with such a device; and says nothing about the potential costs associated with such a device. Indeed, the release does not tell readers anything about the research that underlies the device. Based on the information in the release, the device appears to be — at this point — little more than a concept. As the National Cancer Institute notes, “Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world.” Indeed, cancers claim the lives of hundreds of thousands of people each year in the United States alone. With that in mind, it is important to be cautious when announcing a new tool that “can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.” To be more specific, one should at the very least be prepared to provide meaningful information to support the claim.

How does hot water immersion —  that is, ten 1-hour soaks at 102ºF over two weeks  — affect metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in the blood of 10 overweight and sedentary men. The answer? Some mild, transient changes were noted that could theoretically be beneficial. Just because exercise has been shown to transiently increase inflammatory markers and decrease blood sugar, and hot water immersion does the same thing, doesn’t mean that the latter might substitute for the former. Furthermore, the research into the relationship between inflammation and sugar/insulin levels is mostly in rodents, and extrapolating these benefits to humans is unrealistic. Yes, exercise can temporarily trigger an anti-inflammatory response at the molecular level, as well as decrease sugar/insulin levels.

It is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Some prostate cancers are more aggressive than others, however. A test that could distinguish between aggressive and more manageable cancer types could help some patients avoid unnecessary and risky radiotherapy and surgery. An estimated 40% of prostate cancers detected by the standard PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test are considered over-diagnosed. For decades, the great majority of these men were aggressively over-treated with surgery or radiation. In recent years, more men with low-risk cancers are opting for active surveillance, a monitoring strategy that involves repeated PSA tests and biopsies. Only men with evidence of cancer progression will be offered curative treatment. However, the current methods for determining low-risk status — PSA and Gleason score — are considered relatively crude.

650,650,"New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows","And since patients are usually kept on the drugs for long periods of time, if not indefinitely, that information is important to readers. Otherwise studies show that other side effects are probably similar. The prevalence of this condition within the population makes it a topic of broad interest, both among the public and among the professionals who treat them. The single quoted source in this story is the main author of the study and the story fails to mention that some authors have ties to major pharmaceutical firms which manufacture these kinds of drugs. The novelty here is simply that this meta-analysis is aimed at clarifying uncertainty surrounding the comparison of these two classes of drugs and their efficacy in treating cardiovascular disease.",true,"This Washington Post story reports the findings of a study that compared the efficacy of two classes of drugs available to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) — angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs. It involved a meta-analysis of more than 100 earlier studies monitoring more than a quarter-million patients who were at high risk for CVD. The results showed the two types of drugs to be equally effective with the major difference being a lower chance of side effects with the use of ARBs. With a bit more information on harms and a better grasp of the limitations of this study, the Post’s coverage is more solid than a competing HealthDay story that was based on a news release. But the story lacks voices other than that of the study’s lead author, and it doesn’t disclose the relationships that several of the authors have with the pharmaceutical industry. For patients with high blood pressure, there are numerous studies that demonstrate medications to lower blood pressure are associated with decreased rates of heart attacks, strokes and to a lesser extent, kidney failure. Given the number of different choices available from a range of classes of medications, how do patients and doctors decide on which to use? Here the comparison is between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). When considering which agent to use for a given patient, a physician generally considers the relative benefits, harms and costs of the different agents, as well as any patient factors that may lead one class of agents to have particular advantages or limitations (for example, if the patient already has a high potassium level, use of either an ACEI or ARB may be problematic since they both raise potassium levels further). The current study seeks to address mainly the relative benefits of these two classes of medicines and glosses over harms and costs while not even mentioning patient-level factors. In terms of the benefits, the authors suggest that initial studies comparing ACEIs and ARBs were biased by the times in which the original studies used to justify approval were performed. Specifically, the older ACEIs studies came at a time when lifestyle and other medication options were more limited than the following decades when ARBs were studied. It is difficult to confirm or refute this assumption, but studies of these classes in a more comparable time frame would decrease bias associated with temporal trends. The current study adds evidence that these two classes are similar, but this isn’t really dramatically new information. Indeed, many guidelines suggest ACEIs or ARBs as being equivalent. The advantage of ARBs is better tolerability, as mentioned in this article, but the disadvantage remains cost. Though the article provides one line saying that with more generics available for ARBs, the cost difference has diminished, but even the cost of generics appear higher for ARBs than ACEIs. Thus, for many clinicians even an increased recognition of similar benefits may not lead to much change in practice given differences in costs"

A look at some of the pricey components — soy milk, tofu, supplemented margarine, etc — suggests that it might. A bigger problem may be finding a health professional who can instruct patients in how to follow the diet in a healthful way. As the researchers acknowledge in their paper, the diet was “complex” and the study had a “high” attrition rate of 22.6% after only 6 months.

There was plenty to like about this story, including comments from two excellent independent sources which added valuable context to the piece. The story also makes the very important point that this study looked only at a surrogate marker of heart disease risk, LDL cholesterol, and not actual heart disease outcomes. But the story didn’t provide crucial information about costs or availability of the diet components and it didn’t fairly describe how difficult it would be for most people to maintain this kind of diet. These mistakes are compounded by a glaring misinterpretation of the study which is trumpeted in the headline — i.e. that the diet tested in the study lowered LDL cholesterol “more than statin drugs.”  Many people at risk of heart disease don’t want to take cholesterol-lowering drugs, can’t take them because of troubling side effects, or don’t achieve their targets on drug therapy alone. Others may have cholesterol levels above target but below the range where statin therapy is indicated. Diet-based interventions such as this “portfolio diet” represent an important potential alternative for these patients."

Several days after reaching out to the issuing organization, an abstract on the study was provided, but it did not change the outcome of the review.] The relationship between genetic variance and environmental factors in the eventual development of asthma is not crystal clear. Asthma appears to have a strong genetic predisposition. A child with a parent with asthma is three-to-six times more likely to develop asthma than other children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If breastfeeding infants predisposed to asthma could actually reduce their risk of respiratory symptoms by a quarter or more, then that would be a substantial improvement, both to individual and to public health, especially given the growing proportion of children developing asthma and other respiratory problems."

The headline doesn’t tell us that the technique picks the best course of treatment; instead, the headline tells us that the new technique helps patients and doctors make a decision about what course of action is best. Longitudinal study findings?",true,"The release focuses on recent research published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery. The research assessed the effectiveness of a treatment technique for laryngeal cancer that exposed patients with advanced (stage 3 or 4) cancer to a one-time chemotherapy treatment that, theoretically, would allow physicians to determine whether patients were responding well to chemotherapy. The idea was that patients who responded well could be treated with chemotherapy and radiation, whereas patients who did not respond well would have surgery to remove the voice box immediately, rather than trying chemotherapy and radiation first. The goal was to improve the five-year survival rate of patients. The researchers reported that this technique — called “induction chemotherapy” — was effective, leading to 79 percent survival rates for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer — which is markedly better than the 66 percent survival rate for those patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy. The release does a nice job describing the historical context of these therapies, how available the techniques are and how the study was conducted, with one exception. The release doesn’t mention that this was a retrospective, observational study, not a clinical trial, which is an important limitation. Correlation does not equal causation. Nor does the release provide any costs associated with any approach. People don’t want to lose the power of speech. Whether it’s reading bedtime stories to one’s children or talking about your day with loved ones, speech is an important part of interpersonal communication. Our voices are part of who we are and how we connect with others. What’s more, being able to talk can be a key part of professional life for everyone from teachers and salespeople to reporters and, well, doctors. For that reason, many patients dealing with laryngeal cancer want to do whatever can be done to spare their larynx, or voice box, from surgery. If new techniques can help patients make more informed decisions about the trade-off between survival rate and laryngeal surgery, that’s important news for patients and medical personnel. The release does a fair job of addressing the new findings responsibly. It stresses that there are many options and no one-size-fits-all treatment."

718,718,Prostate Cancer Drug Gets Lukewarm Review,"The story reports that Provenge is the first approved treatment that is designed to try to stimulate a patient’s immune system to attack tumors. The story appropriately reports that Provenge treatment costs $93,000 per patient and is satisfactory based on the criterion. Also, the story does not report that according to the clinical trials Provenge did not make any difference in how long it took for prostate cancer to progress in these men. Readers were not told that the reviewers rated the quality of evidence on survival as only “fair” and that the reviewers spelled out the sort of clinical trials that are still needed in order to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of Provenge. The clinical trials reported that patients treated with Provenge experienced infusion reactions and infections.",mixture,"This story reports on an analysis done for the agency that oversees Medicare of the evidence of the effects of Provenge (sipuleucel-T) in certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It summarizes some of the conclusions and includes comments about how the analysis might influence a decision about whether Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the expensive new treatment. But the story leaves readers with the impression that the drug has been proven to extend the life of the average patient by about four months when actually there are many uncertainties about that estimate due to weaknesses in the clinical trials sponsored by the maker of the Provenge. The assessment done for Medicare underscores the questions that still need to be answered in order for doctors and patients to know whether and how to use Provenge, but that perspective is largely missing from this story. This story portrays debates about insurance coverage of Provenge as a matter of how much value to place on four months of life. But what the federal analysis of the Provenge trials actually focuses on is uncertainty about the amount of additional survival and questions about how other factors besides Provenge (including other treatments that were given to the trial participants) might have affected the trial results. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer occurring in men, though most tumors grow slowly and men diagnosed with the disease typically die of something other than their prostate cancer. Some tumors are aggressive and more effective treatments are needed for these cases. Provenge’s novel immunotherapy approach offers an attractive alternative to existing treatments, but the initial application for FDA approval was rejected in 2007. A new clinical trial was done and the treatment was approved for sale in the U.S. earlier this year. Although historically Medicare and Medicaid have covered treatments deemed safe and effective without considering the magnitude of the expected benefit, the limited additional survival and the high cost of Provenge treatment have highlighted debates about whether and how to consider these factors in deciding whether a particular treatment should be reimbursed."

Baby aspirin linked to reduced cancer deaths The story quotes from interviews with the study researchers and 3 independent experts. The story did not exaggerate the impact of cancer and it accurately described the possible relevance of this study to a large segment of the population.",true,"This story about the apparent cancer reducing effect of daily low-dose aspirin seen in an analysis of data from a collection of earlier heart disease trials provides a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the latest study and its methods than some of the other stories we reviewed. It also provides more specific information about harms that aspirin can cause and it includes several independent voices that add valuable perspective. As a result, readers will be more likely than those who saw some of the other coverage to understand the call for thoughtful consideration before initiating a daily aspirin regimen in hopes of reaping cancer reduction benefits. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease, and there are few proven methods for reducing one’s risk of developing the disease. The study discussed in this story provides fairly convincing evidence that a daily low-dose aspirin does indeed prevent some cancers when taken over the course of many years. Because of limitations in the data, however, it is unclear if these benefits will apply to all healthy adults or if they outweigh the risk of side effects, which can include potentially fatal bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and brain. Individuals need to take these uncertainties into account when deciding whether they want to commit to taking aspirin every day for many years."

Losing weight decreases the amount of fat and improves insulin resistance — leading to improved sugars. First, the blatant claim that diabetes can be “reversed” rather than pushed into remission for 6 months based on results from 12 participants who represent less than half of those tested. The study the release is based on is indeed intriguing and certainly supports the idea of a better, larger research effort to test whether its findings are confirmed.",false,"This release from Newcastle University describes a very small study that sought to control type 2 diabetes in patients through a reduced-calorie diet and a weight-management program. The results showed that 12 of the 30 participants saw a resumption of normal insulin production that continued for six months, supporting the release’s claim of “reversing” the disease. But what about the other 18 patients? A study this small can hardly suggest its finding are applicable to all type 2 diabetes patients which, in effect, it does. And benefits observed after only 6 months may not be maintained over the longer term. The release also omitted discussion of harms and alternatives, and didn’t give us a good picture of how the study was conducted. Rates of Type 2 diabetes have increased markedly in parallel with rates of obesity, especially in developed countries. It has long been recognized that diet, weight loss and exercise can improve the control of diabetes. Large studies investigating the impact of weight loss surgery have demonstrated that blood sugar results can return to normal after significant weight loss. It has also been shown that individuals who regain weight after surgery can then have blood sugars go up again and need to resume medications for diabetes. Patients and their families may excitedly assume that the approach described in this release is right for them and alter their normal regimen in the treatment of their disease. But adhering to the diet discussed in this release will be very difficult for most people and is not without risks. And despite the release’s suggestion of universal benefit, a “reversal” of diabetes did not occur in the majority of patients.

757,757,Allina study shows patients with very small breast tumors may forgo lymph node biopsies,"That may have been something worth bringing up in the news release. A potential harm of this approach is missing metastatic cancer. All the release tells us is  that among study volunteers with microinvasive breast cancer, just 1.5% had positive lymph nodes. The funding sources are listed in the release. The management of microinvasive breast cancer — which includes assessing how it spreads — remains a common surgical dilemma.",mixture,"The news release highlights a study — that joins about a dozen similar such studies over the past decade — trying to determine if looking for cancer spread in axillary (armpit) lymph nodes is worthwhile in a specific subtype of breast cancer called “microinvasive,” or “Tmic” (which refers to a tumor 1 millimeter or smaller). It remains a controversial surgical dilemma, in part, because some studies have found evidence of microinvasive cancer spreading to the lymph nodes 12.5% of the time, while this study, in particular, found the lowest incidence — just 1.5%. The authors conclude that, based on their findings, they believe microinvasive cancer is akin to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in that spread to the lymph nodes is rare. The researchers conclude from the study that routine node sampling in microinvasive cancer is of questionable benefit. The news release is very succinct in describing the findings of this small (under 300 patients) single-center study. Readers need more information before they can fairly weigh the researchers’ recommendation. For example, the release only notes that spread to the lymph nodes was found in patients with “relatively large” examples of DCIS, without clarifying what “fairly large” means; doesn’t note the average followup period for study participants, or what the outcomes were at the end of the study such as breast cancer recurrence, distant metastatic disease, or death from breast cancer. The release also does not mention if other tumor factors, such as hormone receptor status, were associated with spread to the lymph nodes. Recent advances in mammography and an increase in screening mean more breast abnormalities are detected; however, whether they should be labeled or treated as cancer is not always clear. Removal of some of the underarm lymph nodes (sentinel node biopsy) is generally performed at the time of surgery for early stage breast cancer in order to confirm whether or not there has been spread, and to inform treatment decisions. It is often not performed at the time of breast conserving lumpectomy in cases of DCIS; however, the decision whether to not to perform sentinel node biopsy in cases of microinvasive breast cancer is controversial. Breast cancer is staged according to tumor size (denoted as “T”) and lymph node spread (denoted as “N”). The “T” category ranges from 0-4 based on the size of the tumor in the breast. Tis represents ductal carcinoma in-situ, and T1 tumors are invasive breast cancers smaller than 2cm. Tmic is the designation used for microinvasive cancers — where the invasive component is less than 1mm. Future research in this area will help clarify whether Tmic should be approached more like DCIS or like an invasive cancer. Less treatment would have huge implications for surgeons, health care costs, and especially the quality of life for many patients."

So Goreham is correct that the temperature trend has been flat, but it's flat at record highs.

Left untreated, ALD often leads to death within 1-10 years of diagnosis. And there are precious few treatment options available. What’s more, the primary treatment, bone marrow transplantation, relies on the availability of a donor — and poses significant health risks of its own. All this makes new treatment options incredibly important for ALD patients and their loved ones.

The piece fails to indicate what benefit patients might hope to expect from the addition of this drug to their other treatment regimens. Although the story was clear about the potential harms associated with this drug, it seems a little odd not to more fully explain that it is not yet known whether the drug will be helpful to patients with metastatic non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer – especially since the FDA announced this week that this drug does not demonstrate benefit when used to treat breast cancer. In the absence of information about the benefits, it is not possible to weigh the risk of harm against the potential for benefit. This is an issue that should have been addressed in this story. The timing of this story is curious but probably coincidental – to a degree. The big news about the drug Avastin is that the FDA has decided not to approve it for use in treating breast cancer because it does not improve survival or delay disease progression. While this did receive one line in the story, instead of hyping the potential for use of this particular in lung cancer, the space might have better used to examine what are the expectations for a drug used to treat a metastatic cancer. Drugs need to be not only safe, but also affective in order to add value to a treatment regimen.

791,791,New York City Council votes to add e-cigarettes to smoking ban.,"Bloomberg’s detractors have derided him for trying to impose a “nanny state” in America’s largest city, pointing to his bans on smoking, trans fats and the attempt to limit the sale of large sugary drinks. Critics of the law contend that such a ban would do more harm than good. As a “smoker” puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that, unlike cigarette smoke, contains no tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who sponsored the bill, said at a press conference on Thursday that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine enforcement of anti-smoking laws because their appearance is similar to traditional cigarettes and could “re-normalize smoking in public places.”  E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in a variety of exotic flavors such as bubble gum and bacon. “I’m extremely concerned that a well-intentioned but scientifically unsupported effort like the current proposal to include electronic cigarettes in New York’s current smoking ban, could constitute a giant step backward in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking,” Carmona wrote.",true,"The New York City Council voted to add electronic cigarettes to the city’s strict smoking ban on Thursday, in what could be the latest of many anti-tobacco measures put in place by outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg."

Despite the fact that other combination blood pressure-lowering medications are available (but not mentioned), the headline and first paragraph of this news release suggest novelty. An editorial accompanying the study put this research in context in terms of what has been learned previously: The TRIUMPH investigators have demonstrated the effects of a promising intervention in a triple half-dose combination therapy, which logically extends findings from prior research to improve BP control among patients with mild to moderate hypertension. And, as mentioned above, there are some once-daily “triple pills” already on the market. Innovative triple pill significantly lowers blood pressure, study finds",false,"This news release does a nice job of explaining the basic design of a study investigating whether a once-daily “triple pill” (that combines 3 different blood pressure-lowering medications) is more effective in lowering blood pressure than doctors’ usual approach. But there’s plenty of room for improvement here including: presenting the findings in a more meaningful context for patients, including the substantial adverse outcomes noted by the researchers, and using much more toned down language for results that are neither novel or all that significant. Notably, there is a significant financial conflict of interest involving the authors. This should have been made clear to readers. The global importance of poorly controlled high blood pressure is well-stated by the authors in the introduction to their study published in JAMA (paraphrased): High blood pressure is the leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease globally with most of the disease burden occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The availability and affordability of medications is a critical issue. About one-third of individuals with high blood pressure in these settings receive treatment. Only about half of patients treated in high-income countries and about 1-in-4 patients in low- and middle-income countries achieve blood pressure control. A fixed low-dose combination therapy with inexpensive blood pressure-lowering drugs has the potential to address several barriers to improve blood pressure control worldwide. Indeed, there’s significant need for a simple-to-take, effective, and affordable medication to address this issue. If successful, the benefits to patients, and the profits for developers, would be massive."

On the positive side, the release does a good job of explaining why adjuvant treatment to enhance the immune system after bone marrow transplant may be necessary in certain leukemia patients. Relapse rates may reveal important clues to how long patients may live or how they will feel, but then again they may not.

The release’s incomplete, one-sided presentation will most likely lead to a flurry of overblown media coverage that could have negative repercussions for the many women who cannot or choose not to breastfeed. There are many reasons for women to think that breastfeeding is a good choice for their babies. Is leukemia prevention one of them? That’s the suggestion of the study reported on here, which is a re-analysis of previous studies examining the question. It’s worthwhile research, but let’s remember that these underlying studies all relied on a backward-looking case-control design that is subject to selection bias and a variety of other potential problems. And the scope of the potential benefit for this condition, which is thankfully quite rare, is limited. Our worry here is that women face a number of physical and lifestyle constraints that may affect their ability to breastfeed. And women who can’t breastfeed already experience guilt that they aren’t doing enough for their babies. Should they also be made to feel as if they are putting their children at increased risk of cancer? That’s not a justifiable message based on this study. But without more careful communication of study limitations and other context, we’re afraid that that’s the message that could ultimately reach the public."

This is an important oversight given that, even with a surgical or endoscopic procedure, these other interventions are likely to play an important role in helping patients keep off any weight that they lose. Although it doesn’t rise to the occasion of sensationalism, we do have concerns over the use of the term “non-surgical” to describe a procedure that certainly sounds like surgery.",mixture,"More information on potential harms and availability would have made this news release on three medical interventions for weight loss stronger.

We disagree with the release’s use of the term “non-surgical” to describe the procedure since it involves internal cutting and suturing of internal organs. However, the release does a good job of addressing cost and comparing the outcomes of various procedures. According to the NIH, 35.7 percent of U.S. adults are obese — and obesity increases an individual’s risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and other health problems. On top of those health risks, obesity also has an adverse effect on an individual’s quality of life. Patients with obesity may view medical procedures, such as ESG, as effective ways of helping them lose weight — and a study that compares costs and outcomes of several procedures is a useful means of helping patients consider their options. For the most part, the release does a good job here. However, additional insight on the lifestyle choices needed in conjunction with the procedures, and more information on potential harms, would have offered a fuller overview for readers."

860,860,Surgeons Move From Knees to Hips,"Although an expert says that the procedure is meant to prevent future arthritis, this is not quantified; without good data on people who did not have the procedure, it is conceivable that arthroscopy could promote arthritis. Also, the story does not mention open surgical procedures, the historical “gold standard,” which can also restore the normal clearance that separates the femur and hip socket. The story does not mention the cost of hip arthroscopy or other methods to treat labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The anecdotal evidence of long-term benefit provided by one surgeon–that “hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis”–is controversial, and viewed with skepticism by many experts. The story includes interviews with two surgeons who perform a substantial number of hip arthroscopies.",false,"This news story introduces readers to arthroscopy as a treatment for hip pain. It explains what the procedure does and the theoretical basis for its potential benefit. But the story fails to mention costs or potential harms, and cites expert testimony in lieu of evidence. In brief:  Costs and Harms: The story mentions neither. Although harms appear to be uncommon, readers should have some sense of their relative frequency and severity. Evidence: the story says that hip arthroscopy can “fix” acetabular labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement. And yet it fails to describe the quality of the evidence to support this claim. There are virtually no high-quality clinical studies to support the treatment. The story also mentions that diagnostic imaging can be unreliable, and suggests that some doctors can pinpoint the diagnosis better than others. But recent literature reviews show that standard diagnostic techniques in use today (imaging and clinical examination) can not accurately or consistently identify the source of pain in people with hip complaints. Readers should understand that when diagnostic techniques are imprecise, people may receive treatments they don’t need or not receive treatments they do. Quantification of Benefits: The story provides no quantitative estimate of benefit in the short or mid term. A surgeon contends that in the long term, “hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis.” News stories should carefully evaluate such claims. In the April 2009 issue of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, editor Richard Brand,MD, concludes a commentary by saying, “While current [hip arthroscopy] procedures clearly relieve pain and restore function and to a lesser degree restore motion in large portions of patients, we do not know whether these procedures will delay the development of osteoarthritis in middle age and beyond.” (Clin Orthop Rel Res 2009;467:605-7)    Sources: The story quotes two surgeons who perform a substantial number of hip arthroscopies.

We also applaud how this story addresses the potential harms of the vaccine. This story reports both the relative risk reduction (55 percent) and absolute risk reduction (from 13 to 6 cases per 1,000 people per year), but we wish it had told readers that 71 people would have to be vaccinated in order to prevent one shingles attack. We encourage broader use of this sort of statistic about the number of people you need to treat in order for at least one person to benefit. However, like the other stories, this one does not tackle the limitations inherent in this sort of observational study. Shingles is a terribly painful condition caused by the chicken pox virus. It often reemerges late in life. Although a large clinical trial demonstrated that a vaccine could reduce the risk of shingles attacks and postherpetic neuralgia under idealized conditions, things are often different in the real world. This study of actual clinical experience adds an important perspective on the effects of the vaccine, but stories about this sort of study need to clearly address the limitations of observational trials and the ways that bias and confounding factors can muddy the results. Finally, the take-home message here is a clear need to promote shared decision-making between caregivers and patients on this issue, because this is not a slam dunk must-do vaccine."

There was no information about the costs of the various treatment options, though this was not the focus of the article.",mixture,"This story tries to explain a new analysis of many studies of cardiovascular and stomach bleeding problems caused by painkiller use. Although the background material for the article is complicated, this article is less helpful to a reader than it ought to be. Without presenting how often the events like heart attack, stroke, heart arrhythmias or kidney disorders occur, it is not possible for an individual to evaluate how much concern it causes them. Although these are serious risks and individuals thinking about or currently taking these medications should consider them, the article did a a poor job of clearly delineating treatment options. There is confusion about the various risks and how they differ among the available treatment options. Though the article mentioned sticking with a drug which hasn’t caused problems in the past, waiting seven years after FDA approval before trying a new medication, using naproxen plus an acid-reflux drug (without specifying the class that is most successful in this role) and recommending use of ‘pain ointments’, it did a poor job of clarifying how a given individual should assess these options and how they apply to themselves."

We’ll rule it Satisfactory with some reservations. There are no absolute figures included, only relative risks. It does not appear that any conflicts were hidden, but all news releases should routinely report a summary of funding sources and disclosures.",false,"This release about the ability of grip strength testing to predict death and disease rates leaves readers without enough context and ultimately overstates the importance of the findings. While the tone of the release is measured and the quotes include some caution about interpreting the results, there’s no mention anywhere in the release about the limits of observational studies — which are discussed both in the study that’s the basis for the release and the accompanying editorial. And although overall death rates are unquestionably an important outcome, the release does not tell readers what it would mean for a person to be identified as having a 17 percent higher risk. What use is that information and how would it affect how that person is cared for? “Why This Matters” is something this news release should have educated us about. A clinical test result is useful only when it helps people make decisions. This release should have spent more time addressing how the study results might be applied. Would identifying a person as being at a 17 percent increased risk of death or a 7 percent increased risk of a heart attack change how doctors would monitor or treat him or her? Would someone be prescribed a statin based on a finding of decreased hand grip strength? Even though the study was intended only to assess how grip test results in a wider variety of countries compare to previous findings in high-income countries, the release could have at least briefly mentioned how such test results are commonly used in clinical settings. What’s more, it’s clear that news coverage, feeding off this news release, is reporting on this without caveats about observational studies, and therefore, delivering an incomplete message to the public.

Immunotherapy reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis The news release does not misrepresent the novelty of the approach and the lead investigator asserts that not all rheumatoid arthritis patients should be using this combination, saying “In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs).”  It appears that the use of the “extra low” doses are simply a novel use of standard drugs, possibly in patients who would never have used the drugs in the past. We learn that Professor Aida Babaeva, the lead investigator, is the head of the Department of Internal Medicine, Volgograd State Medical University, Volgograd, Russia, but not the degree to which she may have connections to companies making these drugs. Normally, that quantification would earn the release a satisfactory rating but the definition provided here for “cardiovascular risk” does not include heart attacks and strokes.",false,"This news release asserts that a study found that combining two biologic drugs which contain extra-low doses of antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interferon (IFN) can “improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk.” But the accuracy of that statement depends on what your definition of “cardiovascular risk” is. If your definition includes the risk of heart attacks and strokes (as it surely does for most people), then the statement is questionable at best. The release does not mention any of those outcomes and instead focuses on “unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure.” The news release is rich in mechanistic details, ie: how the treatments’ processes may help reduce markers of cardiovascular risk, but poor in important details of interest such as potential harms, costs and impacts on heart attacks or strokes. Granted, it was a small study, but it would have benefited from appropriate caveats around the actual outcomes observed, the potential for harms, and an overall sense of context. [Editor’s note: The European Society of Cardiology, which issued the release, has appeared on HealthNewsReview.org’s Wall of Shame twice before (see here and here) and this release comes close to meriting a repeat appearance.] In rheumatoid arthritis cytokines, a type of proteibn such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN), start to attack healthy cells. If low-dose anti-TNF or anti-IFN drugs could reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis as well as decrease cardiovascular risk they may make a huge contribution to rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. If many people with rheumatoid arthritis also have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease it is useful to study if biologic drugs can reduce those risks by slowing down or halting the disease process."

The story mentions there was an increase in physical functioning in the growth hormone group, but we are not told how much they improved in physical functioning or increased muscle mass. Can growth hormone prevent aging? The story does note that this study does not represent a breakthrough in preventing age-related decline in physical or cognitive functioning. How big was the benefit?",false,"This story notes that using growth hormone to counteract the effects of aging is controversial and that it is not FDA approved for this use, yet the story mentions growth hormone is available in “anti-aging” clinics. The term ‘anti-aging’ is a misnomer, as there are no proven medical interventions to stop or reverse the process of aging. Federal law states that distributing or administering human growth hormone for age-related health problems or for cosmetic use is illegal. Growth hormone is currently only approved for adults with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) and for children with pituitary disorders. The promotion of growth hormone to counteract the effects of aging, namely a decline in physical functioning, is not new; however, the benefit of this use has not been established and the long-term safety is unknown. In this randomized controlled study, an increase in physical functioning was reported in the growth hormone group, but we are not told the degree of this benefit, or if the difference in functioning (measured by improved balance, climbing stairs and heel-to-toe walking) between this group and the placebo group was statistically significant. This story notes that diet and exercise are preferred methods of prevention for staying healthy and functional as we age. However, the story focuses on the notion that normal physical decline involved with aging needs to be counteracted with a pill, such as growth hormone. The natural decline in growth hormones with age may actually be protective. The comparison of prescription eye-glasses for older adults with taking growth hormone to improve physical functioning is unfounded and qualifies as disease mongering. Eyeglasses are an intervention to improve a manifestation of aging, i.e. degenerating eyesight, and glasses pose few (if any) risks to physical health. Growth hormone may pose serious risks to the endocrine and cardiovascular systems, and long-term use may actually reduce longevity by increasing the risk of prostate cancer in older men.

The news release offers this comparison: “Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don’t need.” Previous treatment guidelines (JNC 7) recommended only lifestyle changes for the average-risk prehypertensive patient.",true,"This news release describes an analysis of data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study showing a link between a buildup of calcium in coronary arteries and heart attacks in patients with borderline high blood pressure, referred to here as “prehypertension.” The study asserts that coronary artery calcification (CAC) can be used to guide treatment decisions for these “gray zone” patients. Aside from an overreaching headline and sub-headline, the news release delivers essential information including costs, harms, availability, and study limitations. Nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults have prehypertension, defined as blood pressure between 120 and 139 for the first number (systolic) and/or 80 to 89 for the second number (diastolic). Preypertension is associated with a higher risk of heart attack as well as a heightened risk of developing high blood pressure, which increases the risk of stroke. But the concept of “prehypertension” is somewhat controversial. The most recent hypertension guidelines (JNC 8) do not include this classification. It’s still a leap of faith to imply that identifying this risk group and more aggressively treating their blood pressure would significantly reduce their cardiovascular risk. Patients generally are advised to make lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss, but medication is sometimes prescribed. A tool to better determine which patients would benefit from aggressive treatment — as coronary artery calcification scans might prove to be — could help clinicians make better recommendations, improving outcomes and reducing costs."

937,937,"CT Scans Can Reduce Lung Cancer Deaths, Study Finds","CT Scans Can Reduce Lung Cancer Deaths, Study Finds The story does say that a nationwide lung cancer screening program would be “enormously costly,” and it does mention that screening leads to additional tests and treatments. It also notes that early trials of CT scanning of smokers had failed to demonstrate a difference in death rates. This story fails to mention quitting smoking as a way to reduce the risk of death. Dr. Henschke has been criticized both for making claims about benefits of CT screening that went beyond the available evidence, for having ties to a leading manufacturer of CT scanners, and for taking funding from a tobacco company.",true,"This story concisely reports the announcement that the long-anticipated National Lung Screening Trial indicates that heavy smokers who were offered a certain type of CT scan were less likely to die of lung cancer than similar smokers who were offered chest x-rays. It includes valuable comments that help readers understand what was found and, more importantly, some of the limitations on what is known. However, the lead sentence skews the story by highlighting that researchers saw a 20 percent relative difference in lung cancer death rates, while failing to make it clear that the absolute difference in death rates was much less than one percent, because of the small number of few lung cancer deaths in either the CT (354 or 1.32%) or x-ray (442 or 1.65%) group compared to the size of the total trial population (about 53,500). The National Cancer Institute reported that 300 smokers would have to undergo screening in order for one life to be extended. Readers should have been shown that aspect of the results. Putting a spotlight on relative differences in rates usually magnifies the effects of an intervention. Absolute numbers – and the number of people that need to undergo the intervention in order for at least one to benefit – should get at least equal billing in order to put trial results into perspective."

The researchers found no increased risk of asthma, depression, lung cancer or mental illness, which the story seems to accept as a big reassurance. We felt the story did not squarely address the study limitations as described by the authors themselves in the paper. Instead, the “surprising news” came in a single-source story, lifting quotes from a news release, without any independent perspective or adequate context. Millions of individuals, of all ages, are making current decisions about medical and recreational marijuana use every day. Medical research on the health impacts of that exposure matter for each person and for society as a whole. This story over-valued the conclusion of a single small study based on a sample of only young men.

The release should have been clearer that actual human health benefits won’t be known until after testing in the field.",false,"This news release about a smartphone-based infectious disease testing device confuses speed and device cost with benefits to patients and public health. It oversimplifies infectious disease detection and response.

However, the release doesn’t point out vital distinctions between performance in the lab and in real-world field use, or between the cost of a device and the total cost of a public health program that uses such a device. The release does not put the status of this device into context with other similar devices being developed by universities and companies around the world. We note that the release does report the funding source and the commercial intentions of the researchers. News releases should include essential context, not just certain facts that put researchers’ work in the most positive light.

The description of the benefits is very poor, vague and unscientific. These products are available from other manufacturers for purchase on the internet for varying costs. Lipogen Targets PMS/PMDD Relief, Naturally As noted above, there is precious little information about the volunteer subjects except that they are women, and under age 40.",false,"This news release announces an Israel-based company’s success in obtaining a U.S. patent for a proprietary “phospholipid formulation” called PS Plus, which is purported to treat physical and “emotional” symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Somewhat misleadingly, the release suggests the formulation was “designed” to address PMS and PMDD, when in fact it appears to be the same single-ingredient supplement already sold to provide “brain support,” “sharpen memory” and ameliorate “stress.” Prevalence statistics presented in the release are contradictory and qualitatively lightweight. There is evidence in the literature of some clinical testing of phosphatidic acid, a natural phospholipid, or fatty acid derivative of soy lecithin, used as a carrier for some experimental drugs, but it is the only active ingredient mentioned on the product website – and not at all in the release — and there is precious little information about other ingredients or costs anywhere. PMS is a very common health condition in women of reproductive age. As such, women in this age group and in many countries may be interested in “natural” remedies to alleviate some of the symptoms. Additionally, Americans are high users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. Recent studies have noted that in the United States, “approximately 38 percent of adults (about 4 in 10) and approximately 12 percent of children (about 1 in 9) are using some form of CAM.” Moreover, CAM use among adults is greater among women and those with higher levels of education and higher incomes – exactly the population this news release is trying to reach. The supplement industry’s so-called “orthomolecular” therapies, which claim to maintain health with the use of natural compounds, have long been the subject of public health and scientific controversy, and come-and-go fads among consumers who spends millions on supplements for which rigorous evidence of clinical value is at best scant. For an aging population of boomers, in particular, the promise of protecting and boosting brain health (and by inference reducing the risk of age-related dementia), has been especially appealing, particularly if the products claim to be “natural” and with no ill effects. Similarly, for younger women, claims of safe, natural relief for  PMS and related syndromes are appealing, given that the conditions have long been “medicalized,” and such treatments as hormone replacement therapy and anti-depressants — all carrying risks and adverse effects —  have been over-prescribed and costly. Consequently, there is likely to be substantial interest in a product that promises to relieve what the release says are “more than 200 different symptoms” of PMS, and protect and enhance brain function."

Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome — but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome. These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, approximately 370,000 people die of coronary heart disease each year in the United States. Many adults make decisions about their diet, activities and lifestyle based on how those decisions may affect their heart health. Research on subjects such as how omega-3 fatty acids affect heart disease risk play an important role here. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, people in the U.S. spend $1.2 billion each year on fish oil supplements, largely because they contain omega-3s that consumers think will reduce their risk of heart disease. But increasingly consistent evidence shows that fish oil does not, in fact, protect against heart disease. If people are going to make informed decisions about their personal health — and how they spend their money — they need to have good information that they can actually understand. News releases like this one make it hard for most consumers to understand exactly what the research says."
959,959,XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) Associated with Significantly Reduced Time in Hospital and Decreased Costs Compared to Standard of Care in New Study of Patients with Low-Risk Pulmonary Embolism (PE),"It requires a close reading of this news release, and the study, to realize that this should have been framed as early discharge while on a blood thinner did not result in harmful outcomes compared to patients who were admitted and had longer hospital stays. It also gives some background on an earlier study to establish that this isn’t a brand new idea. It’s made somewhat clear that both the news release and the study are sourced from Janssen Pharmaceutical Company (who’s developing rivaroxaban with Bayer). In effect, attempting to spin this study to suggest that rivaroxaban was better than its competitors in treating pulmonary embolism is a rather significant mischaracterization of what the study attempted to demonstrate, which was the safety of an early discharge strategy compared to keeping patients in the hospital. Pulmonary embolism is a relatively common disorder with a very wide range of severity and mortality.",mixture,"iStock / Getty Images Plus The news release is about a study that explores if patients with pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in the lungs, who are at low risk for complications can be sent home from the emergency department early rather than be admitted to hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: One group of patients were sent home early while taking rivaroxaban (Xarelto), a type of blood thinner, whereas the “usual care” group could get any blood thinner of their physician’s choosing, including rivaroxaban, and hospitalization. The study findings suggest that early discharge of low-risk patients was safe and feasible and also resulted in cost savings because of less time spent in hospital. Unfortunately, the news release seemed to suggest that it was the use of rivaroxaban that resulted in cost savings–rather than the strategy of sending low risk patients home early. The news release failed to state was that over half the patients in the comparison group who got usual care also received rivaroxaban. In other words, the news release implies that rivaroxaban was being compared to other anti-coagulants when what was actually being compared was an early vs. late discharge strategy. Janssen’s misleading news release could result in news stories trumpeting rivaroxaban as a superior blood thinner, when that is not what this study looked at."

Plus, staff would need to be trained to use the device and interpret the results. We think the release earns a satisfactory here for adding a caution that doctors have not yet forged a clear link between documenting changes in blood flow in the brain after a concussion and treatment. Existing strategies to detect changes in blood flow in the brain—magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and “traditional” transcranial Doppler devices—are compared to the advanced version of TCD ultrasound tested here. The release states that the TCD ultrasound device “was able to differentiate between healthy and concussed athletes 83 percent of the time” compared to lower success rates for other procedures.",mixture,"A Los Angeles-based company has found that its “advanced version” of a transcranial Doppler (TCD) device is able to pick up changes in blood flow in the brains of recently concussed athletes, potentially increasing the likelihood of a useful ultrasound device that can be available on the sidelines of sporting events to diagnose concussions in real time. The abstract of the study is being presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting, and the association issued this news release as part of its conference outreach. The news release does an admirable job of explaining the experimental design that led to this finding, getting specific about the nature of the participants and using language understandable to lay audiences. Its omission of information about potential costs, harms and conflicts of interest is less ideal. Journalists, of course, will also need to be sensitive to the fact that the research has not yet undergone peer review. [Editor’s note: Kathlyn Stone, one of three reviewers on this news release, worked for the American Academy of Neurology from 2000-2004 as senior manager of media relations. She has no current relationship with the AAN.] According to the release, more than 1 million athletes in the United States sustain concussions each year. Detecting those “hits” early—ideally on the field of play—and determining which require medical intervention would be valuable. That being said, there really is no medical intervention to prevent sports-related concussion except to abstain from more contact. If the test were sensitive enough to detect early signs of concussion, it could prevent some additional damage that could result from continuing to play."

Potatoes are a big focus of the study, of course, but here’s where the news release falls short, too: The study notes — and the news release ignores — that the potatoes being studied included french fries and potato chips. All potential health harm from these foods is completely ignored. (Such harm is ignored in the study, too.)

But it does not return to verify or elaborate on this point in less vernacular language. For instance, later on the story reports that patients whose tumors do not have the mutation showed significant tumor shrinkage. It would have been useful to reiterate that patients who did have the mutation and took Erbitux saw outcomes no different from those taking the placebo–the core finding that supports the ""doesn’t work"" formulation at the top of the story. It’s also important to note that tumor shrinkage should not be equated with considerable benefit – which should be expressed in terms of improved survival, lower recurrence or improved quality of life.

998,998,Nonsurgical treatment can correct congenital ear malformations in infants,"In short, while we give the news release a pass for suggesting (rather than clearly stating) that this was a retrospective study, the description of the study in the release is fundamentally wrong. The release refers to study co-author H. Steve Byrd four times, but never mentions that he has a financial interest in EarWell systems. Higher rates of ear infections? Given that online cost estimates for the EarWell system range from $2,500 to $4,500 per ear, this is a significant oversight. It’s possible that some reasonable proportion of such ears do OK without intervention.",mixture,"Infant ear, before and after. Image: Becon Medical website The news release focuses on a recent journal article that evaluates the use of a nonsurgical treatment called the “EarWell system” to treat malformations of the ear in newborn infants. The news release reports that results were judged “good to excellent” for most patients in the retrospective study. However, the release poses some significant problems for readers. For example, the release doesn’t discuss cost and does not tell readers that the study co-author quoted extensively is the inventor of the EarWell system. The release also treats ear deformation and ear malformation interchangeably — a distinction made clearly in the relevant journal article. This is particularly important because the numbers discussed in the news release sometimes refer to patients with deformities and sometimes to patients with malformation. Ear malformations and ear deformations are not the same thing. As the journal article itself makes clear, “deformations are characterized by a misshapen but fully developed pinna [or external portion of the ear] with no missing skin or cartilage,” whereas “malformations demonstrate a partial absence of skin and/or cartilage resulting in an underdeveloped pinna from an error in embryologic development.” The headline, section headline and first three paragraphs all refer solely to malformations. Deformity is mentioned for the first time in paragraph four, and in such a way as to make many (if not most) readers assume the terms deformity and malformation are interchangeable. But they’re not interchangeable. Here’s one reason that matters: the release later tells readers that “results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity.” And, based on the journal article, that’s true. But it wasn’t true for ear malformations — which is what the headline and opening paragraphs would lead readers to expect. Parents of newborn infants want to do what’s best for their children, and having to make medical decisions for their infants is a stressful and emotional ordeal. Those decisions can be particularly tricky when the medical decision to be treated is not life threatening. Confusing news releases do not help people make informed decisions under any circumstances, but that is particularly true in circumstances as fraught as those facing parents of a newborn."

Magnetic brain stimulation causes weight loss by making gut bacteria healthier The release suggests that dTMS can influence pituitary hormones and neurotransmitters, which are known to affect appetite and certain microbiota, respectively, but very little is known in this area of research and it would be wise to tread with caution through this conclusion. After doing a bit of independent information gathering, it seems that even though dTMS may be more cost-effective than other more invasive neurostimulation techniques, each session can cost a patient roughly $400-$500, according to PyschologyToday. Neither the release or the abstract it’s based on addressed whether volunteers in the sham group (those who didn’t receive dTMS therapy) also lose weight or fat mass.",false,"The focus of this news release from The Endocrine Society is on research examining the impact of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) — a non-invasive treatment that can stimulate different regions of the brain — on weight loss, hormones and signaling molecules that can affect metabolism and appetite, and composition of the gut microbiome in 14 obese human subjects living in Italy. Microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, most of which are within the gut, and their genetic makeup. The results indicated that volunteers who underwent dTMS lost more weight and fat mass than those who had a sham procedure and that changes were seen in the microbiome profile in individuals who’d had dTMS. The release didn’t discuss any changes in the sham group, and there was no discussion of where these results fit within the total body of evidence in this area of research. Most importantly, the release takes significant liberties by stating that dTMS can directly impact microbes living in the gut, without considering the impact that weight loss and lifestyle changes have on microbial composition. Employing a more cautious interpretation of the results, and including a discussion of costs, risks, and comparisons to other weight loss treatments would have significantly improved the release. Researchers and clinicians work relentlessly every day to find treatments for obesity and its chronic health consequences, and yet, new, safe and effective techniques are few and far between. It’s well known that obesity treatment and management are critical concerns in the United States and abroad. Any new technique that might influence weight loss, appetite, or the gut microbiome is exciting to consider, given that lifestyle changes and prescription weight loss drugs often have limited long-term impacts. However, this news release overstates and oversimplifies the results of the study without fully addressing the complex interplay between weight loss, metabolic hormones and neurotransmitters (the brain’s chemical messengers), and the microbes living in our gut. Change in one of these components typically doesn’t proceed without the others, and the mechanisms are extremely intricate and multifaceted. This release seems to leap from Point A to Point C in a conclusion that does not show appropriate and cautious interpretation of the results of this very small study."

The story plainly states that the procedure is increasingly common and widely advertised. The article uses as sources the study itself, the lead author, and two independent medical specialists. Given the possibility of economic self-interest by proponents of laparoscopic surgery, this information would have been very useful. The story explictly compares the harms of the two surgical approaches in terms of short-term complications and longer-term consequences.",true,"This newspaper article reports on the findings of a study that compares prevalence and outcomes of minimally invasive laparoscopic prostate removal with the standard ""open"" surgical method. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology provide a useful snapshot at a time when laparoscopic surgery is rapidly becoming popular. The news article does a solid job of describing the findings in detail and providing comments from independent sources who help interpret them. The reader takes away the idea that laparoscopic surgeries, despite their increased popularity, appear to have significant potential harms. But the article leaves some major questions unanswered. First, the newspaper report does not mention costs. Robot-assisted procedures are inherently controversial because the equipment is so costly but the benefits unknown. By not mentioning costs of the surgery, the article strips the findings of context. Second, the study itself looks at a very narrow question–it compares the two surgical approaches in a 65-plus population. But the analysis did not account for disease state, mortality, the side effects of surgery men are most likely to care about (impotence and incontinence), or even whether the laparoscopic procedures were robot-assisted. The possibility that selection bias colors the findings is obvious. This is an important piece of research in the field. But given its limitations, it’s not clear that reporting on the findings to a large audience has much public value."

1019,1019,Blood test that could predict arthritis risk,"Remember the drugs for rheumatoid arthritis all have side effects – some of which can be quite serious. If the test isn’t 100% specific, it means we’re telling some patients who are otherwise fine that they’re going to develop something bad in the future – when in fact they won’t. So we’ll flag the release here. The release suggests the test will “improve diagnosis” and help patients get the right treatment early in order to manage their disease. Understanding whether there is a clear point where the test is positive or not would be useful information.",false,"This release from the University of Oxford describes a new blood test that researchers there developed after zeroing in on the protein that collects in the joints of people with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of the protein can predict the advance of rheumatoid arthritis many years before arthritis symptoms develop, according to the research findings published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Among some of the 2,000 individuals who were part of the study, the protein, called tenascin-C, was found as many as 16 years before disease symptoms appeared. The release does a good job describing the science behind the test but may leave readers wondering, “What’s next?” That’s because we aren’t told when and where the test will be available and there’s no mention of early treatment strategies — what the options are, what they entail, how long it lasts and what it might cost. Most doctors screen for rheumatoid arthritis among patients presenting with joint symptoms. Tests to diagnose RA aren’t perfect but have gotten better over time. This news release highlights a new test that may be able to identify patients who have not yet been diagnosed. As such, it would be predicting future RA in patients who do not yet have symptoms or other findings such as arthritis changes on x-rays. Identifying patients with so-called “pre-RA” might appear to be a good thing, but it may not be as simple as implied in this news release. First, it is one thing to retrospectively examine whether blood samples performed years earlier can identify people we’ve already classified. The next logical step would be to prospectively see if we can take patients who don’t have any symptoms and use the test to say “positive or negative” and then wait to see if the test correctly predicts a future diagnosis. This is complicated by the need to say who should we use the test on. Everyone? Someone who may be at risk for other reasons? It isn’t clear and the news release doesn’t help us. Second, since no test is perfect and there inevitably will be false-positives, what does it mean to label someone as being likely to develop future RA if in fact they won’t? Third, even if the test is correct, it isn’t clear what to do with the results. Should we start treating these patients with medications to prevent future symptoms? If the treatments had no side effects, one could argue to do so. But we know that the treatments for RA all have side effects, some quite serious. For those with debilitating symptoms, the risks of such medications may be justified. But for someone who has no such symptoms, it isn’t as clear. One would like to see studies saying that use of this test result leads to better outcomes. No such data exists. Finally, there is no effort to state what would be the potential costs of using such a test in routine practice. One would not only need to consider the cost of the test itself, but also the downstream costs associated with treatment and the potential savings in terms of RA complications avoided."

The Clinton campaign took issue with our characterization of the post, saying that they never meant for the headline to say that Cruz tried to ban all contraceptives on five separate occasions. However, we think ours is the most obvious interpretation of the language in question. At most, it might have hampered the ability of individuals to receive contraceptives from one specific provider, albeit a significant one.

The strongest conclusion about Cruz’s views that one could draw from these examples is that he might support a ban on certain types of contraception (but not all) through his support for a personhood amendment. The other examples are even more limited and deal with what employers would be required to pay for, for instance, or whether a major birth control provider should continue to receive federal funding.

He was a supporter and advocate for the revolutionary socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua during the 1980s. What's false: Contrary to claims of subterfuge or secrecy on his part, de Blasio has publicly discussed the deeply personal and somewhat traumatic reasons for his decision to change his name. Furthermore, while he was during the 1980s a strong supporter of the Sandinistas, de Blasio has more recently articulated a measure of criticism of the movement."

1045,1045,Former President Barack Obama's administration was to blame for the shortage of protective equipment like N95 respirator masks in the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.,"“Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion,” the president said Thursday. In late March 2020, amid a widening COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump sought to blame previous administrations for the fact that frontline medical workers facing a spike in cases were reporting urgent shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE), notably N95 respirator masks that filter out particles in the air. From the Times’ report on March 20, 2020: After the swine flu epidemic in 2009, a safety-equipment industry association and a federally sponsored task force both recommended that depleted supplies of N95 respirator masks, which filter out airborne particles, be replenished by the stockpile, which is maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Bloomberg reported that Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar told Congress in February 2020 that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), a reserve of emergency medical supplies, contained “30 million surgical masks and 12 million of the more protective N95 masks. Readers asked Snopes.com to verify the claim that the Obama administration was directly responsible for the shortage of equipment.",mixture,"What's true: The U.S. federal stockpile of N95 protective face masks was largely depleted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak and was not restocked.

What exactly does “satisfaction” represent in this context? They are not mentioned. But the release would have been strengthened by noting that newer “open fit”  hearing aids also try to tackle the dual hearing loss problem for many people.",false,"Synchrony EAS (electric acoustic stimulation) hearing implant. Image credit: Med-El USA, the device manufacturerThis news release from the University of North Carolina purports to advise journalists and the public about clinical research from the university that helped gain recent FDA approval for an implantable hearing device designed for adults with a form of moderate to severe hearing loss. But this news release is a not-very-thinly veiled infomercial for the device’s maker, and a promotional piece for and by the head of the university department whose faculty members clearly stand to benefit from marketing it. The release is full of hyperbolic praise for the device (“The technology is remarkable and so were the results…”) and the university’s role in the clinical trials. But it is very light on quantitative data and information about costs, complications and side effects that would help readers judge the pros and cons of an invasive cochlear implant. The release offers no links or references to published, peer-reviewed data; to the manufacturer’s website; or notes on potential conflicts of interest. There is some useful information about the prevalence of hearing loss in the U.S. and about what is novel about the implant. But this releases reads more like a commercial brochure than an informative and educational summary for public awareness. Hearing loss is indeed a significant and growing problem and a threat to an aging population. In recent years, hearing loss has been tied by research to cognitive loss (as described in this 2013 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine), as well as social isolation, traffic accidents and a host of other physical, emotional and social ills. Because Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers do not cover the cost of hearing aids — which can run into the thousands of dollars for state-of-the-art devices — most adults who need them don’t have them. For the most severe, disabling forms of “sensorineural”  hearing loss, cochlear implants can be life-changing, and the device described in this release could have novelty and benefits in addressing both high and low frequency hearing problems. Significantly, most insurance, including Medicare, covers the cost of the device and implant surgery. But the benefits of the implants come with risks, including the need for general anesthesia, damage to facial nerves, infections, tinnitus, and numbness. Adjustment to the devices can take months of habilitative services — and removal rates remain high in some populations. Long-term effects, moreover, still are largely unknown. For all these reasons, news releases and stories about surgical implants should offer context about the benefits, risks, costs and alternatives."

1049,1049,New Merck osteoporosis drug boosts bone density,The story cites only Merck’s data and researcher. New Merck osteoporosis drug boosts bone density The story does not falsely dramatize or expand the definition of osteoporosis. This is especially appropriate given the high costs of current drug treatments for osteoporosis and the recent patent expiration of Merck’s blockbuster drug in this category. The story is built around unpublished results of a phase II trial conducted by the company.,mixture,"This story, about results from a Phase II trial of Merck’s new osteoporosis drug odanacatib, should not have been published in a mainstream publication. Phase II results are not necessarily predictive of Phase III results or of FDA approval. Readers looking for new treatments for osteoporosis are likely to assume incorrectly that safety, efficacy and availability are assured. The reporter could have tempered the story by interviewing independent experts with no stake in the drug being studied, who likely would have pointed this out. Further, by talking to an independent clinician, the reporter could have learned about existing treatments for osteoporosis and how this one could–possibly, and at some point in the future–compare. Supplements, diet and exercise have been shown to slow or even halt osteoporosis for some patients. So have some drugs currently on the market. The story also fails to clarify a point that would be valuable to consumers: That risk of fracture, not bone mass density, is the most meaningful outcome for osteoporosis drugs. Because this trial did not look at that outcome, the drug’s practical clinical value remains untested. The report should have plainly stated this caveat. And finally, it is well known that osteoporosis is a ""big market opportunity"" in the pharma trade. In other words, new drugs in this field, if well-publicized and well-marketed, can be huge revenue and profit drivers for the company. By failing to mention price, and the very strong financial motivation for a company to be first-to-market with a novel drug in this category, the reporter misses an opportunity to help educate readers about a source of rising healthcare costs–and to invite a skeptical view of news about unpublished Phase II results about this drug. Which is why we think this story should not have been published in a newspaper."

Most commercial insurers haven’t covered this procedure yet, but will probably start covering it as a result of Medicare’s policy.",false,"This story is about a new treatment option for low back pain – artificial disk replacement. For viewers suffering from low back pain, trying to make a treatment decision, there is too much crucial information missing in this story. Most people with low back pain will not be eligible for the device. Viewers need to understand how little is known about the risks of the device and how it compares to other treatment options. Even if the short-term risks/benefits look good, there will be major unanswered questions abouts the durability and long-term safety of the device. The 25 year old woman in this story may require additional spine surgery in the future as this device wears out. This is not intended to be a one-time cure. In the story, the viewer learns that “More than 75% of Americans suffer back pain at some time.” While this may be technically correct, it’s not clear that all find it “significant.” The kind of back pain that would make an individual eligible for disc replacement surgery represents a very small percentage of all cases of back pain. Most people suffer acute episodes of back pain that resolves on its own. More importantly, the story implies that “injured discs are often to blame.” In fact, only a small percentage of low back pain is attributable to an acute disc herniation. Finally, the statement that “doctors have treated problems by fusing spinal bones together” is unclear and also misleading. Most patients with low back pain are not going to need surgery of any type. For patients with an acute disc herniation, the accepted procedure is a discectomy, not fusion. The story does quantify the benefits of treatment.

Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of problems with social communication and interaction, as well as behavioral issues that can be repetitive, compulsive, and/or disruptive in many social settings. The condition cannot be predicted or cured, so any news coverage about a potential screening method needs to be extremely cautious and pay special attention to the limitations of the study at hand, as well as include critique from independent sources.

The news peg is that the Academy of Neurology updated its guidelines, which is a legitimate starting point for many health-related articles. The story briefly explains the guidelines are based on “six-month studies.” Looking at the published paper itself, it appears they were based on a total of two short studies (both under 6 months) that showed twice-weekly exercise “is likely to improve cognitive measures.” Long-term improvements are unknown. This story makes that clear.",mixture,"This brief article in U.S. News & World Report discusses recently published professional guidelines for treating a condition of aging known as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI) with regular moderate exercise. As the article itself notes, scientists and physicians “gush” endlessly about the benefits of exercise for seemingly everything, and now for MCI. However, the story didn’t make it clear that this recommendation is based upon just two studies, both short-term. Nor did it give us a sense of the scope of the benefits. Does exercise help a little? A lot? The rapidly growing numbers of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia are clearly causes for genuine concern and even alarm in the United States. Beyond the human costs are the financial burdens on families and the overall health care system. And the persistent failure of hoped-for benefits from clinical trials of  drugs has added to the drumbeat of worry. As a consequence, those with symptoms of MCI (which may or may not be linked to the onset of actual AD or dementia), may turn to “alternative” interventions such as diets and dietary supplements, “brain training” with crossword puzzles, and exercise. Because exercise has been demonstrated to have specific and non-specific physical and psychological benefits for many people, it’s no surprise at all that guidelines from a respected journal suggesting that moderate regular exercise can improve memory would be of interest. But when the ability to summarize the precise impact of exercise is muted at best; and when the potential exists for “victim blaming” among those who fail to exercise, journalists should take great care in promoting such guidelines."

1097,1097,Constant migraines may be from an unlikely culprit: a deviated septum,"Such profligate and unsupported waste of society’s resources flies in the face of claims of ""cost-savings."" But important questions remain unexplored. The availability of surgery to correct a deviated septum is not in question, so we’ll rule this one not applicable. There was no evidence presented in this story beyond the anecdotal impressions of the book author, Dr. Smith. We think that by failing to challenge in any way Dr. Smith’s estimate of a 90% success rate, readers are likely to come away with an exaggerated view of what this treatment can do for the average patient.",false,"This story advances the claims of a book author/ear, nose and throat surgeon who says that many patients with migraines actually suffer from migraine-like headaches caused by a deviated septum in the nose. While the idea sounds reasonable enough, what’s lacking here is evidence. Most problematic is that the story unquestioningly passes along the author’s claim — based entirely on his own practice data — that he has a 90% success rate when treating headache patients with deviated septums. That’s a statistic that will probably help sell lots of books and drive more patients to the author’s practice, but we doubt it accurately reflects the benefits that the typical patient can expect from this treatment. Also troubling is the story’s failure to mention any possible harms associated with the surgery promoted in the book. Considering that septoplasty itself can provoke new chronic pain in some patients, this omission is particularly glaring. Migraine headaches can have a huge impact on people who suffer with them and  these patients may seek out multiple treatments in the hope of finding some relief. When evaluating these therapies, journalists need to go beyond sources who stand to gain financially from promoting them, including book authors. The most important question to keep in mind is: Where is the evidence that they work?"
1098,1098,Botox use on migraines gains support,"The story rightly points out that Botox did not signficantly reduce the number of headache episodes in the study but that it did reduce the number of days the patients said they suffered from headaches. The story does a very good job of describing the strength of the available evidence, including the challenge of how to appropriately measure headache duration or severity. The story quotes multiple experts who provide valuable persepctive. Botox use on migraines gains support Clearly Botox is not a new idea, but it is not approved to treat chronic migraines.",true,"Botox, or Botulinum Toxin Type A is typically regarded as a way to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. However, it is increasingly being used to treat disorders related to overactive muscles and twiching because of the temporary muscle paralysis that Botox causes. This story reports on a news release by Allergan, the manufacturer of Botox, about the results of a new study looking at Botox as a preventive measure for chronic migraine sufferers. This story does a commendable job outlining the evidence to support Botox use for this indication. It rightly points out that there are serious questions about the methodology and that the details of the study have not been made available. Furthermore, it accurately describes the availability and novelty of Botox and is careful to quote multiple, independent experts who provide valuable perspective. The story could have been improved by describing the costs of Botox injections, and mentioning possible harms or side effects and the alternative treatment options, of which there are many. Overall, a very well balanced and informative piece that could have easily gotten off course."

1100,1100,New research to treat acute malnutrition,"Nevertheless, the basics for understanding how the study was conducted are provided. New research to treat acute malnutrition Many people’s first question upon reading about a peanut buttery kind of nutrient supplement might be whether it produced any allergic reaction or other side effects in infants. It would be pretty much impossible to engage in disease mongering about acute malnutrition. In fact, it didn’t, but the news release doesn’t tell us that.",false,"This news release describes a study published in PLOS Medicine, showing that among moderate acute malnourished infants lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS)–a kind of fortified peanut butter–produced more gain in muscle and organ weight over 12 weeks than a corn-soy blend (CSB) porridge. Acute malnutrition affects over 50 million children across the world. It is characterized by bodily wasting following experience of a recent period of starvation. According to the researchers, until now there has been concern that because LNS has a very high fat content any weight gain it produced would be composed primarily of fat. The distinction of this study is its demonstration that LNS not only resulted in more weight gain, but that weight gain was in muscles and organs (lean mass) rather than fat. Children with the most severe level of acute malnutrition are at risk of death. Increasing the effectiveness of interventions with children before their malnutrition becomes severe could save millions of lives. However, readers would take away a better understanding of this critical issue if more space in this news release had been devoted to explaining the study itself, and less to citing various researchers and partners about how important the project was."

If this release would have only discussed the primary outcome goal of the study — “to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count” — then we’d probably give it a satisfactory rating on this category since it provided clear numerical data showing a significant reduction in percentages among patients taking the drug versus those on placebo. The release makes no mention of alternative treatments for asthma. This transparency is needed for readers to ascertain bias. Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers",false,"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily.

What were the benefits and drawbacks to a study like this?",mixture,"This brief story discusses a new study published in JAMA Neurology about blood tests for two biomarkers that may assist in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries among patients brought to a level-one trauma unit. The story was careful not to exaggerate the potential of the blood markers in assessing the severity of concussions. (Note: See our separate review of the news release here: Another ‘simple blood test’ for concussion PR release over-promises) However, it missed the mark in some important ways: It didn’t tell us how these biomarkers fared on accuracy, and it lacked independent sources, such as a brain injury or concussion expert who wasn’t connected to the research. We saw some of the same limitations in another story we reviewed about the use of flashcards in detecting brain injury. If a simple blood test can accurately predict traumatic brain injury, then patients may be spared the effects of radiation from a diagnostic CT scan, and clinicians– including ambulance and emergency room attendants–might have a more rapid and affordable diagnostic tool in assessing patients. However, a lot more research is needed to know if this is the case. These individuals had enough of an injury to be treated at a level one trauma center. As such, the study may not be able to answer whether the test can be used in the majority of cases, which involve milder injuries. And these results were only applicable to adults, even though the story references drawbacks of CT scans for kids, implying these blood tests could be used for children, too."

In addition, the release states that existing treatment “will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor,” whereas the new treatment “overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread.” But it’s not clear that the new treatment does, in fact, do more than “stabilize the disease” or that the cancer won’t “grow and spread” with the new treatment, since a chart in the abstract suggests that the disease unfortunately remains uniformly fatal even with the new treatment.",false,"A futuristic-sounding medical treatment is paired with a bold claim of survival benefit in this news release.

That faculty member, in turn, suggested to us that the release was in fact cleared and sanctioned by the University. The University of Louisville media contact has refused to provide any further clarification. We’re unsure whom to believe, so we’ve deliberately left blank the area where we’d normally indicate the news release source. The fact that we can’t even tell where this news came from should raise questions about the process that produced it.] Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, killing nearly three-quarters of victims within a year of diagnosis and about 94 percent within five years. One reason, according to the CDC, is that nearly 80 percent of patients are diagnosed too late for surgery (which can extend median survival by about 10 months). Thus any treatment shown to be effective in treating the disease–especially a minimally invasive, non-surgical method–could possibly reduce patients’ suffering and provide them significantly more quality time with their loved ones."

This was not mentioned in the news release. The release provides context on how many people could be affected globally by COPD.",false,"This release summarizes an observational study noting a relationship with two groups of men (middle aged and older), their consumption of testosterone replacement therapy and whether they are hospitalized for respiratory problems. It found that testosterone replacement therapy users had a decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users. While observational studies such as these are useful and hypothesis generating, they do not have the strength of a randomized, blinded trial and hence one cannot conclude that such associations are causal. Better information about the harms, costs and conflicts of interests of the researchers would have made this a better news release. If testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) slows the progression of COPD in men by producing a positive lung function, this could indeed be a public health advance. Observational studies, however, are problematic in that the two cohorts of men observed (those who take TRT and those who don’t) may be different in other fundamental ways. There could, for example, be a “healthy user bias” in that the TRT cohort of men may be naturally healthier at the start, and that any improvements in COPD function may just be a function of their basic overall health. Studies like these allow us to draw conclusions, but only that there is an association — not that TRT caused a reduction in COPD."

Legalizing abortion gave medical professionals the okay to conduct the procedure out in the open and to research safer methods, which helped bring overall maternal mortality rates down. By the time the court decided Roe in 1973, New York, Alaska, Hawaii and Washington legalized abortion in nearly all cases, while about 13 other states legalized it in some cases, such as in the case of rape or incest. In fact, receiving an abortion now carries a lower mortality risk than moving forward with a pregnancy.",true,"As a result of Roe vs. Wade, ""America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically.""

Smoking contributes to many diseases, including heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and cancer. The CDC says smoking is the leading cause of preventable death — worldwide and in the US.

There are established guidelines for BRCA 1/2 testing from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that most insurance companies honor. The article mentions that several of the study’s authors have links to the industry and to companies that produce the genetic test panels. We would like to have seen those terms – key issues when reporting on the utility of genetic testing — mentioned and discussed somewhere in the article. The piece in itself is about an investigation of the clinical usefulness of additional (alternative) genetic panels to the “routine” BRCA1/2 tests.",true,"This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)"
