The release states that this research was supported by the drug manufacturer Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals but did not spell out that Bayer markets interferon beta-1b under the brand name Betaseron. We also wonder — if patients routinely receive a therapy before official diagnosis — whether that risks treating people for a condition they do not eventually develop. Treating at the Earliest Sign of MS May Offer Long-Term Benefit",mixture,"This release summarizes a study that followed 11-year treatment outcomes of two groups of patients with early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). All of the patients had experienced a first episode suggestive of MS, called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan suggesting MS. Up to 85 percent of people with CIS go on to develop MS. The two patient groups were randomized to either receive interferon beta-1 by injection immediately or receive a placebo for two years. After two years, the placebo group could receive their treatment of choice. The patients who received the drug immediately appeared to have fewer relapses over the 11 years of study, according to the lead author, but no advantages were observed in other patient outcomes such as overall disability and MRI scans. The release would have been stronger if it provided more context for judging the reduced number of relapses, especially in light of the two groups showing no difference in disability. The release also omitted mention of significant potential conflicts of interest, the high annual cost of interferon beta-1 and the drug’s side effects. Society faces tough questions because of the high prices of drugs that target the immune system, such as interferon beta-1b for multiple sclerosis. This news release suggests drug therapy should begin sooner for patients without including any of the controversy on cost playing out in the United States and Europe. Last year authors of a different research study, also published in Neurology, called the rise in MS drug prices “alarming” and wrote it was also puzzling, since some of the drugs are not new. “Why the costs of MS DMTs [disease modifying therapies] in the United States have risen so dramatically is uncertain. However, the simplest explanation is that pharmaceutical companies raise prices of new and old MS DMTs in the United States to increase profits and our health care system puts no limits on these increases,’ they wrote. Why is cost so important to mention? This drug study, in particular, has significant potential conflicts of interest, discussed below under the Funding Sources & Conflict of Interest Disclosure criteria."

Even the campaign’s mascot — the zebrafish — makes an appearance. What they did not see was any challenge to the extravagant claims made about cardiac cell regeneration, any discussion of the undoubtedly sky-high costs that would be associated with stem cell treatments, or any analysis by independent experts of the quality of the evidence supporting this line of research. Just about 1 in every 50 Americans has heart failure with about 400,000 diagnosed every year. The prevalence increases with age and the number of people with it will rise as a result of increased life expectancy. Heart failure symptoms can be managed with drugs and, in extreme cases, dysfunction can be helped with implantable assistive devices. But there is no cure. So, the announcement by the British Heart Foundation to raise and spend $80 million on research into cardiac cell regeneration is important and newsworthy. Stem cell therapy, gene therapy, nanotechnology and numerous other futuristic sounding medical treatments are beloved by researchers and health writers alike, and there are promising lines of inquiry to be pursued.

That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."

One of the most important pieces of context for this study was that it only had 12 subjects. That needed to be in the article. In general, the term ""artifical pancreas"" builds unrealistic hope for this technology for patients, and some balance and caution would’ve enriched the optimism with realism, doing a greater service to those with diabetes who are very interested in this topic. This story matters because hypoglycemia is dangerous and self-monitoring combined with use of insulin requires a patient to be an engaged and knowledgeable self-manager. The hope of this technology is that it would function more like a normal pancreas. But that’s it’s hope. Although the story provides little information about the risks and benefits observed in this small pilot study, it implies that it’s almost ready for prime-time, despite late hints at the end of the article that the technology is not there yet. The discussion of the Ritholz research on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) compliance is somewhat disconnected and only loosely germane to the artificial pancreas. Research on CGM, which is approved and in use, has clinical relevance unrelated to the investigational ""artificial pancreases,"" of which it’s a component.

The release gives no sense as to how this study fits into the wider body of research. Treating First Time Shoulder Dislocations with Surgery Can Benefit Young Athletes, Study Shows Is this the first time this issue has been studied? The news release refers to “non-operative” interventions, but does not say what they are.",false,"This news release describes the results of a study presented at an annual meeting showing that athletes who dislocated their shoulders for the first time and underwent surgery had lower rates of postoperative instability and re-operation when compared with patients who had recurrent dislocations before undergoing surgery. It contains lots of numbers, which we applaud. These numbers are important because they add to the limited database available to help guide treatment for athletes who have suffered a shoulder dislocation. As one study put it in 2014, “there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of in-season athletes with anterior shoulder instability, and limited data are available to guide return to play.” But, in stating a causal relationship, the news release goes beyond what the data support. Specifically, the news release says that the study “demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.” The study, which was observational in nature, can only show associations between shoulder surgery and subsequent outcomes — not that surgery after a first-time dislocation was the cause of reduced risks. Also missing from the release: harms, alternative therapies, costs and study limitations. This matters because, in the 2014 prospective study, just 27% of athletes whose shoulders were made unstable due to injury “returned to play and completed the season without subsequent instability.” According to the study abstract, the shoulder is the most common joint dislocation, affecting 2% of the general population, most of them males. And there’s a 50% likelihood of another dislocation after a first one, according to the background into given by the study authors. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, there were some 63 million visits to non-federally employed, office-based physicians specializing in orthopedic surgery in the United States in 2010.

The author quotes the researchers, who pointed out that the lights as they were used in the trial “would not be offensive at all for people to have in the background.” The story acknowledges in the third paragraph that the study involved only mice and notes that more research will be needed to determine whether this intervention has any relevance to people.",false,"This story describes a study in which genetically engineered mice were exposed to an hour of pulsing light daily for a week, with the result that certain toxins associated with Alzheimer’s disease were dramatically reduced in their brains.

The study cited was published in a top journal and could represent a meaningful step on the way toward innovative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The operative word, however, is “could.” This research is years away from impacting human lives, if indeed the findings end up being relevant to humans at all–and that needed to be explained better. Furthermore, the heavy use of medical terminology and a confusing explanation of the rationale behind the study could make it hard for many people to pick up on just how far from application the findings really are. This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications. Alzheimer’s is a tragic disease that impacts hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

The story accurately reports that the researchers saw a tendency toward better outcomes, but that the trial lasted only 18 months, and as mentioned above, the trial was not designed to demonstrate health effects. Although the story does note that niacin (spelled incorrectly by the way) is the only drug that reliably increases HDL, we would have liked to have seen a bit more information about the role of diet and exercise and how researchers think a CETP inhibitor like anacetrapib (if approved) might fit into the context of other approaches. However, the story does not make it clear that this trial was designed to detect harms that were at least 25 percent more common in the treatment group than in the placebo group… so it was not powerful enough to rule out side effects that were less common than that threshold. The story says that this trial included patients with coronary heart disease, but according to the article on the trial in the New England Journal of Medicine the participants also included people who were considered to have a greater than 20 percent chance of a cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke, etc.)",true,"Beginning with the lead and continuing throughout, the story reminded readers of the limitations of this trial and that questions about health benefits will have to wait for the next round of experimentation. However, although this story gives readers a balanced view of what researchers reported, it should have told them that the trial was sponsored by a drug company and that the lead researcher has financial ties to that company and others in the field. When a trial is designed to test safety, stories about the results should focus on that question without wandering off into speculation about health benefits that have yet to be put to the test. That’s what this story does. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the “good” HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented. In reality it takes a lot of subjects to even begin to get a picture of the risks and benefits of a new drug. While encouraging, the results of this study are far from conclusive."

Furthermore, when there is no original research involved, and the conflicts of interest are substantial, use of the term “evidence” is grossly misleading. This is promotional pablum, not science."

Second, and more broadly, the efficacy of Kyleena at preventing unwanted pregnancy is not compared to the broader suite of birth control options available. A control group would be helpful in putting the rates of adverse effects into context. It’s a tricky question. Given that this release was issued by the manufacturer of Kyleena, the oversight is especially odd.",true,"The news release focuses on a forthcoming birth control product called Kyleena. The product is implanted in the uterus and releases the hormone levonorgestrel, which the release says can prevent pregnancy for up to five years. The release does a fair job of describing the clinical trial that led to FDA’s approval of Kyleena, and also addresses potential side effects associated with the product. However, the release does not address cost at all. The release also fails to discuss similar alternatives that are already on the market, or even offer any information comparing the effectiveness of Kyleena relative to other forms of birth control.

This release stacks up favorably to a Bayer news release on Essure which we also reviewed (and discussed in a blog post) in terms of discussing harms, quantified benefits and quality of evidence. However, neither release addressed costs.] According to the CDC, more than 7 percent of U.S. women use long-term, reversible contraceptives — i.e., intrauterine systems or implants — to avoid unwanted pregnancy. The widespread use of these technologies means that they are both economically important and — more importantly — that such birth control systems have a significant impact on the health and well-being of millions of women. As such, it is newsworthy when new products receive FDA approval and come to market. But in order for potential users — and their healthcare providers — to make sense of a new product, they need some basic information. For example, they need to know how the new product compares to existing products on the market — and how much they will cost. This release falls short on both of those fronts."

However, it should be noted that all of the comments from the USPSTF came from a news release. It was also worth mentioning that an average risk person who is informed about the screening may chose not to be screened as a reasonable choice, but only as part of a shared decision making process with her/his doctor. While we’re sympathetic to the challenges of doing so on deadline–especially when the task force went out of its way to not cover this ground–this nonetheless should have been included.",true,"This story about updated colon cancer screening recommendations offers readers a reasonably faithful summary of the key conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The key point of the new guidelines is that several methods of screening all work pretty well for people ages 50-to-75, yet many Americans don’t get screened. Unfortunately, the article doesn’t do much to inform the reader beyond the task force’s news release (available for download here), only stating that “there are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations.” While it may be cumbersome to explain those benefits and risks in detail, it still would have been useful to go over some of the specifics, such as risks and costs, so that people get a basic idea of some of the complex trade-offs at hand.

Although the story quotes from a news release, it acknowledges the source of the quotation and also includes an interview with the author of the accompanying commentary. Injury is always a possibility, but that’s apparent enough that we don’t think the story was obligated to discuss this.",true,"This story reports on a large meta-analysis of observational studies looking at the association between sedentary behavior (sitting and TV-watching), exercise, and risk of dying prematurely. Its main take-home message is “it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ‘moderate intensity’ exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day.” Although that’s a faithful account of how the study researchers frame their results, we think it’s likely to leave readers with a misleading impression. Despite what the researchers may claim, this type of study can’t prove that exercise can “undo the damage of sitting” — all it can do is show associations between these behaviors and risk of death. There are many factors, other than exercise and sedentary behavior, that affect one’s risk of death (e.g. diet, illnesses, socioeconomic factors), and the story didn’t explain that researchers can’t account for all of those factors in a study like this. Suggesting that exercise “reverses” the damage of sitting implies a certainty to the study’s conclusions that simply doesn’t exist. Every day, readers are bombarded with health news messages from observational studies such as this one relating to diet, exercise, and other lifestyle issues. Because this type of research is not definitive, it is liable to be contradicted by the next study that comes along, which in turn generates a new set of headlines that is in conflict with what readers just heard from the last study.

But economists told us that while the trade agreement is arguably a slightly more advantageous deal for the U.S. than its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement, it won’t generate enough additional federal revenues to pay for the border wall, and shouldn’t be construed as Mexican payments, anyway.“Even if we accept conceptually the argument that government revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes ‘Mexico paying for the wall,’ there are no plausible assumptions of USMCA’s impact that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion,” said Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution and a research associate at the Global Economic Governance Programme at the University of Oxford.Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, agreed.“Relative to NAFTA, the Mexican government would not nearly lose enough tariff revenue that could be constituted as paying for the wall, at least the wall as previously envisioned by the Administration; nor would the U.S. government revenue increase enough based on a dynamic score,” said Smetters, who was an economist at the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s. Even if it is, though, there is nothing in it specifying that Mexico will pay for any border wall.The president’s argument is that Mexico will pay “indirectly” because of benefits that accrue to the U.S. through the new trade agreement. “The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress,” Trump said.The president overstated the economic cost of illegal drugs.In a 2017 report, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated “the economic cost of the opioid crisis was $504.0 billion” in 2015 — but it is not all “illegal drugs,” as the president said. What are the facts?It’s true that in recent months the number of people caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally has risen, and was actually higher in November (the most recent month for which the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has published figures) than it was when Trump was sworn in.But the total remains far below what it was several years ago, before President George W. Bush doubled the number of Border Patrol agents.During the first 11 months of last year, the average monthly number of apprehensions was not much above what it was in Barack Obama’s last year in office, and it was less than one-third of what it had been in 2000, before the big surge in the number of agents at the border.",unproven,"In a national address, President Donald Trump called on Congress to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall to address what he called a “crisis” on the border.

75,75,Weight loss can be boosted fivefold thanks to novel mental imagery technique,"How difficult would it be for someone to find a practice that can provide FIT for weight loss? Whether done in a for-profit country like the United States or a country that partially or fully subsidizes health care, there are cost considerations. But this study does not appear to have evaluated how people tried to lose weight, instead focusing on the extent to which they were motived to make changes based on the intervention. In other words, it’s possible that some unknown variable was responsible for the FIT group’s success — because it’s not clear whether the study controlled for that. The new paper appears to be the first to look specifically at weight loss, but that context is missing since the release does not place the work in context with other research in the field.",mixture,"The news release focuses on a study reporting that overweight individuals who engaged in functional imagery training (FIT) were more successful at losing weight than individuals who engaged in a type of talk therapy called motivational interviewing (MI). However, the release does not answer many questions that are relevant to determining how useful FIT is for weight loss. For example, because the study does not appear to have collected information on diet or exercise, it’s not clear whether the difference in outcomes stems from differences in lifestyle choices made by study participants. It would have been helpful if the release (and study) had analyzed specifically how increased motivation and lifestyle choices can result in weight loss. The published study notes that data relating to “participants’ experiences and process variables, including frequency of motivational cognitions, self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, self-reported diet and physical activity” were collected but that the results would be reported separately. When comparing the efficacy of MI and FIT, it’s important to know what sort of lifestyle changes study participants made. If a significant percentage of participants who engaged in FIT also joined a for-profit diet program, that support system might explain the differing results. By the same token, it’s not clear if the MI group and the FIT group were matched for initial weight, sex or age — any of which could influence how much weight was lost. Without knowledge of those details, it is difficult or impossible to say how much more effective FIT was than MI (if at all). According to the published research, there were some differences in full-time employment and the range in baseline weight that weren’t addressed in the limitations section of the study and which could affect the reliability of the data."

Since we now have powerful treatment options, there has been a push to begin using them earlier.

Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic techniques for the identification of patients with joint problems in the early stages of RA. That’s the context, and the social problem, described in the article. The study in question, however, is a little different. It’s about understanding the processes that lead to RA and techniques that may, in the future, lead to a test for patients who may develop RA in the future.

It is hardly a ‘mixed’ review when you compare a weighty study that found very marginal effects of the drug in nearly 6,000 women, and put that up against a single compelling anecdote of a women who says her life was turned around by the drug. It’s also questionable to give so much weight to the comments of a clinician with known ties to pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for female sexual problems (and without disclosing those relationships). This is an important piece of reporting because how a new drug performs in clinical studies on thousands of patients has a direct relevance to the women who would be encouraged to take the drug and the physicians who would want to prescribe it. Journalists need to be ultra cautious in reporting on such a ‘sexy’ topic and carefully weigh the comments of clinicians and patients who provide what seem to be ‘market-tested’ testimonials.

The release dedicates a whole paragraph to summarizing potential conflicts of interest, which is welcome and we hope to see this kind of transparency showing up in more releases in the future. The benefits are well-represented in the release, and so is their context.",true,"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer."

Blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester",true,"This release accurately describes an observational study using second-hand data from another study  which found that a relatively inexpensive blood test (HbA1c or A1C for short), commonly used to monitor diabetes, might help identify women at risk for getting gestational diabetes as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. The release does a good job of explaining that the disorder carries risks — including the development of adult type 2 diabetes long after birth — for both pregnant women and their newborns. The release notes that the study does not scientifically demonstrate that measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy can in fact determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. On the down side, the release doesn’t mention what it would cost in dollars or potential over treatment to screen every women in the early weeks of pregnancy;  offers no information about the overall prevalence and incidence of gestational diabetes or any details about the women whose records were studied; and waits until the last sentence to note that there also is no firm evidence that lowering HbA1c levels with diet and exercise before or in early pregnancy will actually reduce risk for gestational diabetes. Public health and obstetrical associations estimate that 1 to 15% of all pregnant women in the U.S. develop gestational diabetes and no doubt a greater percentage worries they might. There are potentially serious health consequences to gestational diabetes for mother and child and although some mothers at higher than usual risk — for example, women with obesity — are screened early, most women have a screening blood glucose test later in pregnancy. Glucose and insulin levels are complicated to interpret later in pregnancy. The notion that earlier detection with a test that measures average  glucose levels over time might lead to lowered rates of the disorder is seductive. But it’s also true that such a scenario is only speculation at this time. As a consequence, news releases about this topic are of fairly wide interest, but must be careful not to over promise."

However, many drugs are effective in prolonging response in metastatic disease without impacting length of life. It would be good to get survival data to back up these claims, or at least provide data on quality of life to see whether the addition of lapatinib made a difference and how much. Additionally, the results of this trial have not been scrutinized in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

There is no specific study to evaluate or discuss in a story like this one; the USPSTF’s recommendations are based on an evaluation of all the available research literature on breast cancer screening and mammography. The story also offers a good primer on congressional action related to the debate, particularly as pertains to legislation that mandates insurance coverage of mammograms for breast cancer screening.",true,"The story provides a good overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story summarizes the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, particularly congressional action on the issue. The story also discusses the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening, though the story would have been stronger if it had more fully explored both the benefits and potential harms associated with women starting mammogram screening early or having the tests more often (something that a competing New York Times story on the recommendations does well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance. Breast cancer screening is a big deal. As the CDC notes, “Not counting some kinds of skin cancer, breast cancer in the United States is the most common cancer in women, no matter your race or ethnicity.” In 2012 alone, 41,150 women died of the disease. Breast cancer also has a profound impact on the economy, with researchers estimating that it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. In other words, it affects the health and well-being of millions of patients and their loved ones, as well as having an adverse impact on the economy. News that relates to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer is clearly news worth covering, particularly when it could inform the decision-making of women and health professionals — and have an effect on women’s access to screening."

The problems have since been fixed and the 50 milligram pill is manufactured there.

143,143,More women are victims of domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday than on any other day of the year.,"“One of the most notable findings, she said, was that an increase of emergency room admissions “was not associated with the occurrence of football games in general, nor with watching a team lose.” When they looked at win days alone, however, they found that the number of women admitted for gunshot wounds, stabbings, assaults, falls, lacerations and wounds from being hit by objects was slightly higher than average. “These are interesting but very tentative findings, suggesting what violence there is from males after football may spring not from a feeling of defensive insecurity, which you’d associate with a loss, but from the sense of empowerment following a win. The presence of Linda Mitchell at the conference, a representative of a media “watchdog” group called Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), lent credibility to the cause.At about this time a very large media mailing was sent by Dobisky Associates, warning at-risk women, “Don’t remain at home with him during the game.” The idea that sports fans are prone to attack wives or girlfriends on that climactic day persuaded many men as well: Robert Lipsyte of the New York Times would soon be referring to the “Abuse Bowl.”  Friday, January 29 Lenore Walker, a Denver psychologist and author of The Battered Woman, appeared on “Good Morning America” claiming to have compiled a ten-year record showing a sharp increase in violent incidents against women on Super Bowl Sundays.

While indicating that it is too early to say whether XL184 actually affects the cancer, the story should have reminded readers of the importance of things like quality of life and survival time.

And it is not clear that XL184 is of benefit to anyone. News about results from a small study that is still ongoing cannot carry enough caveats. It is really too early to know whether XL184 really shows promise or not. It is bad enough when journalists write glowing stories based on reports from scientific meetings. This story goes one step beyond that and reports on the outcome of a small trial before the scientific meeting has even been held. Although there are numerous caveats embedded in the story, it still provides a rather optimistic view of a drug based on early testing in 20 men.

With some of these improvements, the story could have provided a much better service to readers. There’s a lesson in this story for journalists to do a better job checking conflicts of interests in sources. The story didn’t disclose that one of the authors has conducted research on a penile traction device and is quoted on the company’s advertising materials. Penile enhancement — along with hair replacement — is one of the most popular medical interventions targeted at men, and it is often the purview of medical providers outside the mainstream. Because men who perceive themselves as being sexually inadequate are particularly vulnerable to aggressive marketing about ostensible cures, it is especially important to evaluate the claims being made by plastic surgeons and the like.

166,166,Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica,"Chronic lower back pain is not only very common and very difficult to treat, but it’s also one of the leading causes of disability and missed work days. Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica But “minimally invasive” can potentially have more complications than a prior “more invasive” approach. The procedure is, in fact, a refined technique of an older procedure. Study funding is not included.",false,"The main problems with this news release promoting an abstract from a radiology meeting are that it fails to mention the research is unpublished, and there are significant limitations which may well preclude a headline such as: “Pulsed Radiofrequency (pRF) Relieves Acute Back Pain and Sciatica.” The touted benefits of pRF (pulsed energy applied to nerve roots of the spine by a probe) noted in this study are based on difficult-to-reproduce patient questionnaires, and framed with language that makes it very difficult for readers to place in an understandable context. Although alternatives are nicely covered — benefits, costs, availability, and potential harms of the outpatient probe procedure are not. We also reviewed a HealthDay news story about the study. Both the story and news release would have been improved with more discussion about cost, benefits and harms. Chronic back pain that does not respond to conservative treatment, and sometimes includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica), is difficult to treat, a leading cause of disability, and poses a huge economic burden to both individuals and the health care system. Although the search for treatments that are “minimally invasive” are well-intentioned and much needed, this catchphrase can be quite misleading. As we’ve written before, many readers erroneously equate “minimally invasive” with more advanced and effective, and involving fewer complications and recovery time. Rather than prey on this notion, releases should clarify if procedures touted in this way even come close to meeting such expectations. Many back patients have very straightforward questions they need answered: Do I need surgery? If not, what are my alternatives? How effective are those alternatives? What are the benefits vs. risks involved? What will it cost me? Not answering those questions clearly (or making it clear if the answers are unknown) does readers a disservice. Back pain creates tremendous personal, family and economic burdens. In the majority of individuals, the source of the pain cannot be identified, and undoubtedly there are many different causes of back pain. If the source of pain in any individual can be identified accurately, specific interventions may be able to be developed to treat that subset of patients resulting in improved quality of life for those individuals and less economic burden. But it’s also important to keep in mind that in the vast majority of individuals, the pain resolves spontaneously without any residual disability."

Although the experts quoted were clear that the trial was not a ringing endorsement for the use of these supplements to reduce fracture rate, they also cast the use of these supplements in a light more positive than the current study suggested. This article reports on a study to test the common use of calcium by women to ensure bone health. The reduction in hip fracture rate reported in the study was 12% (as compared to 29% for those who took the supplements regularly). Benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplement were presented as percent reduction in hip fracture rates without the context of how often they occur.",mixture,"This piece reports on the outcomes from the Women’s Health Initiative about the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D to prevent hip fracture. Although the results showed that the level of calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce hip fracture, they did find that this level of supplementation did increase the risk of kidney stones. There were several interesting points raised in the study that were not reported on in this story. This first is that the methods used to encourage supplement use was only adequate to get a subset of the women studied to take the supplements. The results also point out the discrepancy between the common measure of ‘bone health’ (bone density) and the outcome of importance (fracture rate). Lastly, the study also showed that women who fell were significantly more likely to have a hip fracture than those who never fell. This raises the question of whether an intervention to reduce the likelyhood of falls would be useful for reducing risk of hip fracture. The overall tone of the article is suggestive that women beyond menopause should still take these supplements, though this is not consistent with the results of the study."

Is this the only harm?",false,"The subtitle of this news release says the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) study “shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurologic health.” But this in vitro lab study only suggests that the fish protein, parvalbumin, binds to a particular human protein called “alpha-synuclein” which has been identified as forming amyloid chains in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The news release should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans, and further, that no cause and effect relationship has been established between amyloid proteins and the development of any neurologic disease. Any news release touching on Parkinson’s disease — or any other of the neurodegenerative disorders that have no cure — is likely to draw a lot of attention from news organizations. Parkinson’s disease alone affects about 1 million Americans and 10 million people worldwide. Although this news release clearly states the disease has no cure, it is riddled with language that implies fish consumption inhibits amyloid formation and that amyloid formation “can be responsible for various diseases,” but that’s an unproven theory and not even addressed by this study. Our concern is that this framing will be adopted by unskeptical reporters and the cause and effect language will be erroneously adopted despite absolutely no evidence to support it."

201,201,Breast-Feeding Linked to Reduced Risk of Preemie Eye Problem,"We paused to take a second look at the statement that ROP “has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time.” That sounds scary, but the story qualifies things nicely when it notes, “The greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries.” That’s good context because it explains that the condition is actually a consequence of a positive trend in health care. To start, the disease ROP is separated into 1) any-stage and 2) severe. The article does not mention other preventative measures to take against ROP besides breast milk and formula. More precision is also warranted regarding the specific comparison being made. Although those topics could certainly sustain such a discussion had the story chosen to address them.",true,"This article consists overall of balanced reporting. There are a few missteps in presenting the quantitative evidence but some very strong points are present as well, including the acknowledgement that the studies under consideration are all observational in nature, and the corresponding reminder that “correlation does not imply causation.”   Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding eye disorder.

The researchers concluded: “While robotic assisted and laparoscopic surgery are associated with fewer deaths, complications, transfusions and shorter length of hospital stay compared to open surgery, robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery is more costly than laparoscopic and open surgery. Additional studies are needed to better delineate the comparative and cost effectivenss of robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery relative to laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.” That conclusion sends a somewhat different message than that delivered in the story – and the difference is important. And the editorial writer stated that the study “failed to capture 3 important elements.” And then he clearly spelled those out. The story didn’t convey the depth/details of those concerns. What are the outcomes that readers/patients should really care about? That’s the question the editorial raised – or that many other independent observers would raise about this study.

The study concludes that partial knee replacements would — in many cases — leave patients “better off” than total knee replacements. With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were. It also didn’t discuss harms of surgery, among other problems. An over-reliance on publicity materials appears to be a pattern — last week the Guardian received a 1-star score from us for a different story that also simply restated what the news release said. Knee replacement surgeries are not uncommon. A 2015 study reported that, as of 2010, there were 4.7 million people in the U.S. who had received a total knee replacement. If partial knee replacement (also called a unicompartmental knee replacement, or UKR) is an option for many patients, and the partial version could improve outcomes and reduce medical costs, then this is a finding with the potential to significantly improve life for patients (and make U.S. insurers happier in the process). However, it’s important to highlight the risks associated with such a decision — even if those risks could potentially be reduced by seeing an increase in partial replacement surgeries over time. The importance of this research is that for some people a less-invasive surgical procedure may be an option, but the choice isn’t quite so clearcut as the researchers imply."

Why not? As our publisher, Gary Schwitzer, wrote: “The word promising means ‘likely to be successful’ or ‘to give a basis for expecting.’ There is far too much uncertainty in medicine for this word to be applied loosely in the coverage of medicine.” Despite this initial misstep, the story does quickly establish the preliminary nature of the research and cautions that it’s much too soon to know if the vaccine will ultimately be effective in preventing HIV infections. It also does a nice job of putting this research in context with other HIV prevention efforts that have succeeded in slowing the spread of the disease. More attention to the possible costs of a vaccine — a huge issue for the developing world countries most affected by the virus — would have rounded out this otherwise solid effort. This new vaccine approach, if proven ultimately to be effective, safe and affordable, could make a major difference in resource-poor settings around the world.

257,257,Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval,"There is brief discussion of abstinence rates, but no mention of the design of the varenicline trials. There is no discussion of any side effects of the drug. Numbers are framed appropriately, however there is no quantiative comparison of one-year abstinence rates with existing drug and non-drug therapies. The critical difference (and the reason this is truly novel) is that it is a partially active drug (that is it does not create the same intensity of effect as nicotine) and that it does not bind to all the subtypes of nicotine receptors. No evidence the story relies solely on a press release.",mixture,"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher’s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories.

The piece does a good job putting the results into context and even compares those findings to the placebo group, giving them a more transparent and helpful context. However, readers would have appreciated being told more of the basics. What are the possible side effects? How much might the drug cost? How is this different from other migraine treatments? Many news organizations used more sensational “breakthrough” language than The Guardian did in this story. But this was still only half a loaf, inexplicably reporting on one migraine study in the New England Journal of Medicine without even mentioning or linking to another migraine study in the same journal with a somewhat similar antibody agent. Why? About one in four US homes and perhaps 12% of the US population (much of it female) experiences migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people each year. There’s no cure-all for the severe headaches, and current treatments and preventative drugs can cause unwanted side effects like tiredness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, heart rate issues, and more. So any alternative that is both effective and safe would be good news. But, as Dr. Richard Lehman wrote on his terrific BMJ blog, “the real worry is that antibodies beget antibodies, and we don’t know how long these (drugs) will remain effective or what long-term harms they might have.” And The Guardian story didn’t adequately address either concern."

261,261,Too Much Fat? Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure gives far more data than a body-mass index,"DXA scans are clearly distinct from other techniques for assessing body composition, but it’s not new. However, since we didn’t see any egregious exaggerations of the obesity problem, we’ll give the benefit of the doubt. This is Not Satisfactory for a simple reason: there is nothing presented to show that measuring body composition with a scan vs. other ways leads to any improved outcomes, whether intermediate or long term or whether we’re talking about weight loss, building muscle mass, increasing athletic performance, or preventing heart disease. The story would’ve been more useful had it mentioned that there appear to be no comparative effectiveness studies on long term outcomes using these different methods. More quantification here would have helped readers judge the value of this tool.",mixture,"A DXA body composition scan featured in the Wall Street Journal. The format of this story — with its hepful “Ache, Claim, Verdict” structure — suggests we are going to be treated to a no-nonsense examination of the evidence supporting dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, for whole body scans to determine an individual’s body composition in terms of fat, bone and muscle. However, the story doesn’t deliver much more than a superficial look at the technology and is lacking in critical perspective. The story concludes that DXA is much more accurate than body mass index (BMI) at calculating someone’s body composition, but doesn’t give readers much information on why this may be important to their health. It focuses on the question of how often one should get scanned, and never challenges the assumption that one needs to get scanned at all. It doesn’t mention that there appears to be no data to show that those who use these scans have any better outcomes than those who do not. We live in a body-conscious society. It’s not clear precisely how much money people in the United States spend on weight loss. U.S. News, for example, reported in 2013 that we spend more than $60 billion a year on weight loss. A year earlier, ABC News pegged it at $20 billion. Regardless of which figure is closer to the mark, the weight loss industry is a juggernaut. And that doesn’t even get into the fitness industry focused on helping us have bigger muscles or more toned bodies. In short, people are extremely interested in losing fat and gaining muscle — and DXA appears to be a tool aimed at, to paraphrase this story, taking the guesswork out of figuring out how well you’re doing. It is, perhaps, inevitable that news outlets will cover this tool and its effectiveness. But these stories should also highlight how and whether they can give people insight into any potential medical problems — or whether it’s primarily a pricey tool for indulging our interest in our own bodies."

Global health experts and the WHO warn there is a risk that a more deadly flu virus will one day jump from animals to people, mutate and infect many hundreds of thousands of people. Of those infections, around 3 to 5 million are severe cases, leading to between 290,000 and 650,000 seasonal flu-related respiratory deaths.

Finally, the uninsured rate in Florida has fallen by one-third since 2013, which paints a very different picture than the ad’s zombie statistic."
279,279,The state of California ignored structural issues with the Oroville dam and paid for programs to benefit undocumented people instead.,"“When the dam is overfull, water goes over that weir and down the hillside, taking much of the hillside with it,” Stork told The Washington Post. Another major outlay ($2.1 billion) results from the need to provide supplemental English language instruction to Limited English Proficient students, many of whom are children of illegal aliens. Eleven years later, flooding due to mid-February 2017 storms forced nearly 200,000 residents living in the dam’s shadow to evacuate their homes. There’s roads, there’s transmission lines, power lines that are potentially in the way of that water going down that auxiliary spillway.” Federal officials, however, determined that nothing was wrong and the emergency spillway, which can handle 350,000 cubic feet of water per second, “would perform as designed” and sediment resulting from erosion would be insignificant, according to a July 2006 memo from John Onderdonk, then a senior civil engineer for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

We give Reuters high marks, though, for finding an outside expert who could temper some of the enthusiasm found in quotes from the authors in both this story and the WebMD piece. We also like that Reuters at least raised the issue of costs. As both stories note, researchers have been trying to find a way to use genetically engineered cells to fight cancer for 20 years, making even a small study like this interesting news. Both stories sounded some cautionary notes, but Reuters could have more thoroughly shown that the study’s results were promising but not proof that a cure for leukemia is within sight."

The same situation applies for mammography – hospitals lose money on every mammogram they do.",mixture,"The focus of this story was a review of a newly-published study demonstrating added benefit of ultrasound in addition to mammography for women at increased risk of cancer due to dense breast tissue. The story appropriately mentions why traditional screening methods may miss an early-stage tumor in this population. It is not the usual standard to do any other screening (aside from mammogram) in women with dense breast tissue situations, except for very high-risk BRCA carriers who now get MRI as well. Ultrasound is already available, as implied in the story, and not a new method of treatment. The broadcast does not mention that physicians and ultrasonographers in the study were trained using standardized screening protocols. In a real-world clinical setting, the availability of properly training physicians and technicians can vary, resulting in greater false-negatives or false-positives. The editorial by Dr. Kulk accompanying the JAMA source article states, ""It is questionable whether the diagnostic accuracy achieved in the study..would have been the same if nonradiologists had performed screening ultrasound."" The story could have mentioned this. In addition, the story didn’t discuss costs, didn’t explain why this study was ""the most definitive so far,"" and didn’t explain benefits in absolute terms which are probably most helpful to most viewers. Importantly, the story mentions that screening may need to be tailored to a woman’s individual risk profile, as well as her preferred screening schedule based on an assessment of risks and benefits."

288,288,"Flashing night-lights may help lessen jet lag, circadian problems","Benefits of those who experience the flashing light therapy over those who have the continuous light therapy were described this way: “A series of flashes similar to a camera flash delivered every 10 seconds over a 60-minute period delayed sleepiness by two hours, compared to a 36-minute delay for those exposed to continuous light for an hour.” These quotes were also helpful in quantifying and understanding the benefits: “In essence, using the night before you traveled from California to N.Y. would move your circadian system two-thirds of the way there before you even left,” Zeitzer said. This article made it fairly clear that this technology wasn’t ready for consumers by mentioning that further research needed to happen and that frequent flyers shouldn’t try this on their own. The article is clear that the study is based on substantial theory about the effects of light on circadian rhythms and mentions previous research that the team had carried out, so there is no misleading representation as to the technique’s novelty. The study could have made reference to other systematic reviews of therapies used to treat jet lag, such as Cochrane Reviews on caffeine or melatonin. The report indicated there was no harm involved:  “In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality.” This report also indicated helpful additional information from an outside observer, Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, who was not part of the new study, who said: “Mistiming light therapy can make jet lag worse.” This report rates satisfactory on the quality of evidence by including cautionary advice from an outside observer saying that independent verification needs to happen: It is “far too early – neither the methodology is available [to] outside research, nor any guidance about safety, nor tests of simulated jet lag in an appropriate ‘realistic’ protocol,”  according to Anna Wirz-Justice.",true,"This study of flashing light therapy enrolled 39 people, and exposed 31 of them to a series of two-millisecond light flashes with changing intervals while sleeping. The other eight were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light. Those who experienced the flashing light were more quickly able to alter their circadian clock and thus, in theory, more quickly adapt to a new time zone. The report covered the main bases found in the published research and, unlike a CNN article on the same study, included the helpful commentary of an outside observer who was able to add context to the meaning and impact of the study. Jet lag is a significant concern for many people who have to travel distances that span multiple time zones, where their ability to work effectively is compromised as the body struggles to adjust to a new time zone. This means a simple, but effective light therapy session could bring much-needed relief to those who have to travel but also, possibly, to those who do shift work and are frequently forced into combat against the body’s natural circadian rhythms. People who work in important jobs where alertness and quick adaptability to changing sleep schedules are required (airline pilots, doctors, nurses, ambulance attendants, truck drivers, etc) may benefit from such a therapy."

309,309,"New blood test may predict cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease, research shows","The news release doesn’t mention that over the past few years many new blood tests for refining cardiac risk have been researched. The news release notes that Mayo Medical Laboratories first released this test in August 2016, and that “the present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.” However, while this test is new, many similar biomarkers for refining cardiac risk have been proposed over the years. New blood test may predict cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease, research shows However, the news release’s contention that those with low LDL but high ceramide levels are four times as likely to have a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event would still be considered a preliminary finding, given the lack of rigorous peer review. Moreover, it’s not clear whether any changes in treatment would actually produce measurable benefits for patients who are at increased risk according to the test.",mixture,"The news release reports on research suggesting that testing for plasma ceramides, a type of blood lipid, might enable doctors to identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage. It provides a readable and reasonably straightforward account of what the researchers did and why it might be important, but there are a number of significant omissions. First, the release should have acknowledged that this test — even if it does effectively identify individuals at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke — may not lead to treatment that actually lowers that risk. Knowing about an increased risk doesn’t mean that risk can be reduced. Many other similar risk markers have been proposed over the years and so far haven’t been found very useful for actually guiding treatment that improves outcomes. Moreover, the research discussed in the release was being presented at a scientific meeting, meaning it has not yet gone through the peer-review process for publication in a journal. In addition, the news release provides no information about the costs of the new test, which appears to be available only through Mayo Medical Laboratories. It also does not discuss the possibility of false positive results, potentially leading to unnecessary treatment. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, kills more Americans than any other disease, including cancer. Although health experts have long advised people to try to maintain low cholesterol levels – especially for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) – research suggests that as many as half of all heart attacks occur in individuals who have normal cholesterol levels. In addition, heart attacks can occur in individuals, especially women, for whom angiograms show no blockage of the coronary arteries."

The paragraph mentions the possiblity that cancer may be a side effect, and that the most promising type of stem cells have not been shown to develop fully into their original counterparts.",true,"This is a first-rate piece of magazine journalism. The article, as much about basic stem cell science as about medical treatment, focuses on one key researcher’s efforts to advance understanding of stem cells. The article puts those efforts in the context of politics, past and current research and the potential for clinical application. It personalizes the story without generating false emotion or hope. It’s a strong example of how journalists can educate the public about the importance and difficulties of scientific research–something that’s very useful against a backdrop of so much out-of-context, misleading reporting about the benefits and dangers of drugs and treatments. It’s particularly useful in an area where political interests have distorted some underlying scientific issues. The story could have been made even stronger if the author had talked to politically neutral people who for scientific reasons are less sanguine about the outcomes of stem cell research. The scientific community has endured years of having to defend the importance–indeed, the legality–of work with stem cells. This has resulted in a nearly united front in the field advancing the message that stem cell research is on the cusp of life-saving application and a transforming force in the history of medicine. This may turn out to be accurate. It may not. Only at the very end does the story explore the safety and efficacy issues that are important barriers to clinical application.

The typical symptoms of HIV-associated dementia include short-term memory loss, slowing of thinking, difficulties with complex tasks, and social withdrawal. Neurological symptoms such as hand tremor and gait difficulties are also common. This story is about a study that tested an anti-seizure medication, valproic acid (Depakote), on cognitive functioning in 22 patients in over a 10-week period. 16 people in the study had HIV-related cognitive impairment, while 6 did not. Valproic acid is FDA approved to prevent seizures, but it is currently also used off-label for treatment of certain mental illnesses and in Alzheimer’s patients, as it is thought to prevent or reverse cognitive decline. The storyâ€™s description of study design and results is incomplete and there is no quantitative data presented on benefits or side effects. The study only lasted 10 weeks, and while there was a trend towards improvement, the story made no explanation of what â€œimprovementâ€ means or how it was measured or in how many people it was observed. It is important that the journalist mentions the need for a larger clinical trial to replicate results. 22 people is a very small sample to suggest generalizability of the results in terms of treating HIV dementia with valproic acid, so the headline is overzealous. There is still no “cure” for HIV-related dementia and current non-experimental options for treating this condition are not mentioned. The story doesnâ€™t mention side effects of taking valproic acid. The quote that it is “safe and well-tolerated by this population” does not provide enough information for a piece reporting the results of a published study. Also, 10 weeks is not enough time to assess long-term side effects for this medication in HIV patients. Anti-convulsant drugs like Depakote can have serious side effects when taken long term.

That would be great to know.",false,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis."

However, it doesn’t talk about costs or study limitations, and the lead offers false hope by stating that a device “common in optometrists’ offices may hold the key to faster diagnosis of schizophrenia.”   Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that tends to emerge during teen and young adult years and can create disabling symptoms. Medications and talk therapy can help. However, treatment can be delayed because it’s difficult to diagnose. Symptoms can overlap with those of other conditions. Also, in teens, early signs such as flagging grades and irritability are common in adolescents."

We wish more stories took this broad view when writing about new drug studies or approvals. The article does a good job of framing the key issues, asking, essentially, whether is there enough benefit to justify the side effects. Not often do stories address this issue, and we applaud their approach. The story comes close to achieving a balance in its attempt to answer this question. For example, the statements by Thomas and Wolfe are excellent alternative opinions to the views espoused by the obesity drug expert camp. But we wish this story had gone beyond a he said/she said look at the evidence and that it had not relied so heavily on sources that have strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry, which is pushing hard for looser restrictions on anti-obesity drug approvals.

As this story notes, a third of the US adult population is obese, and the situation has only worsened in recent years, despite concerted public health efforts to address this serious public health threat. Pills, though, are just one part of the equation. From reading this story, people might believe that the only reason people are obese is because they don’t have access to the right pills. How does this explain the huge contrast between the US and other developed countries in terms of obesity? How does this explain the rapid rise in average body-mass index over the past three decades and the resulting rise in diabetes, heart disease and other health problems? The story accepts as its underlying premise that obesity would melt away if drug companies could find the right pill and that they are being scared away by the big bad FDA.

Certain breast cancers that affect women with inherited BRCA gene mutations are relatively small in number but difficult to treat, and they can disproportionately affect young women. As a result, drugs to treat these cancers are likely to be important news for certain patients and their families. The FDA gave its “priority review” status to olaparib, meaning it determined the drug “would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition.” It’s dependent upon news stories to help put that into context that people understand–does it actually “significantly” improve patient lives?"

377,377,New Study Published on Cover of Urology Finds that Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier Reduces Conflicting Treatment Recommendations between Urologists and Radiation Oncologists,"But while the study itself makes detailed and explicit disclosures about funding and potential conflicts of interest (some of the researchers are employees of the company), the news release doesn’t. Prostate cancer is very prevalent, Medicare can cover the cost of a Decipher test, and about half of men who get prostate cancer are covered by Medicare — so GenomeDx Biosciences has a lot to gain from more widespread use of its product. Clinical studies from leading cancer centers published in over a dozen medical journals demonstrate that Decipher can accurately predict metastatic disease, which men may benefit from radiation therapy following prostate surgery, and can lead to significant cost-savings for healthcare systems.” That’s good enough for Satisfactory rating, although we caution again that the amount of independent value added from Decipher is unclear. We’ll give the release credit here for quantifying the main findings of the study. GenomeDx Biosciences funded the research.",mixture,"In this news release, we’re introduced to a world of confusion among doctors about what to do with a man after they remove his cancerous, walnut-sized prostate gland. And the release offers something that can allegedly reduce that confusion: GenomeDx Biosciences’ Decipher, a test that sniffs out 22 different genetic signals of how a cancer case might play out. Next we’re told about the struggle between urologists and radiation oncologists. The former group is less likely than the latter to prescribe “adjuvant therapy,” typically radiation, after removing a prostate gland. Missing high-risk cancer cases and not treating them is a problem, of course, but so is treating men who probably don’t need it. (Although we’re never really told why that’s an issue.) According to the release, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland. That’s potentially an important advance, but we aren’t provided with crucial context — notably that it’s unclear if the decisions made because of Decipher were actually better decisions that would lead to a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. We’re also never cautioned about the small size of the study, given cost information about the test, or told about potential harms. Among cancers in men, prostate cancer is the second-most common – about 1 in 5 men in the U.S. will get a diagnosis in their lifetimes. It’s also the second-most deadly: Of the more than 200,000 men diagnosed each year in the U.S., nearly 30,000 die. (At least twice as many more black men succumb to prostate cancer as other ethnic groups.) Testing prostate cancer for how likely it is to grow quickly and migrate (metastasize) might save a lot of men from unnecessary follow-up treatments and unwanted side effects. So, a reliable tool to help clinicians make informed choices – and with a consensus of opinion among the doctors a patient sees – stands to help everyone while reducing costs associated with prostate cancer."

We’re told that, each year, catheters in hospitals cause 250,000 infections and cost $250 million to treat. The “Stop CAUTI” program has been around for years, but it’s implied that hundreds of hospitals have never implemented it before in a systematic way. That’s important to note and we’re glad it was included. It could have been made clearer that any hospital can use this safety bundle now that the methods are published widely.",true,"HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person’s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously drain a patient’s urine. HealthDay nicely captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs. The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI,” which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices. The results, as HealthDay explains them? It’s not clear; we’re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research. Indwelling catheters are very common sights at hospitals, since nurses can insert them once and they rarely slip out (a balloon at the end holds them in place). However, about 75% of UTIs are caused by such catheters, according to the CDC, and more than two-thirds of those infections are thought to be avoidable — both through better caretaker training and by avoiding the use of indwelling catheters. Given the suffering and cost, any program that could decrease the rate of such infections, especially one without any new medical devices — just training sessions and use of alternative, short-term catheterization — would be welcomed by patients, hospitals, insurance companies, and taxpayers alike."

The story is strong and scores well because it discusses critical data from the study, offers comments from independent sources and provides information on limitations. It didn’t delve into either costs or harms, but in this case, there seems to be minimal need for either, due to the nature of the research. One minor point we think the story could have made: It remains to be seen if this style of intervention ultimately leads to a reduced risk of stroke, serious heart disease, and/or heart attacks, especially if there is not a long-term barbershop program in place. This was a unique choice for a study presented at the ACC conference. Often, the studies presented at the conference are industry-funded and focus on specific (and often very expensive) drugs or devices. We were heartened to see the news media give this study broad coverage, and found this story especially refreshing to read."

So many, many other factors are influencing cortisol levels besides these reports of traumatic events. None. Other background with regard to studies using hair and cortisol and mental illness were reviewed in the scientific article and the Guardian story might have provided a bit more background. The news article didn’t give any idea of how novel the research is.",false,"This story reports that in an Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol. Here’s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain. So it’s a huge stretch to claim that cortisol in hair “may reveal future mental health risk” in children. We wish the story had been more cautious, especially in its headline, when discussing the implications of this very preliminary research. Childhood lays the foundation for one’s health over a lifetime, so identifying people who have risk factors for health problems early on — as with a simple hair test — is an attractive idea. This might allow for early intervention to modify risk and get people into treatment sooner, lessening the impact of disease or behavioral problems on their lives."

404,404,The European Union ordered reporters to not reporting whether a terrorist is Muslim.,"In this context, it draws attention to a recent study by Teesside University suggesting that where the media stress the Muslim background of perpetrators of terrorist acts, and devote significant coverage to it, the violent backlash against Muslims is likely to be greater than in cases where the perpetrators’ motivation is downplayed or rejected in favour of alternative explanations. From the ECRI report: The Leveson Report, published in November 2012, pointed out that “certain parts of the press ride roughshod over others, both individuals and the public at large, without any justifiable public interest”, and that a significant number of news stories fail to meet standards of integrity and propriety and reflect a culture of “recklessness in prioritising sensational stories, almost irrespective of the harm these may cause and the rights of those who would be affected”. In November 2016, rumors began to swirl that the European Union had ordered the media not to report when terrorism suspects were Muslim, presumably because of pressure from Islamic groups. Criticism of the report centered around this passage: ECRI regrets that a way has not been found to establish an independent press regulator and that, as a result, certain tabloids continue to publish offensive material, as indicated above.

We hope health journalists take care when re-interpreting the language for the older Americans considering their many options for treating a common ailment like painful knees. The release offers no discussion on costs of viscosupplementation or insurance coverage restrictions. The benefit data is limited and there are no mention of harms. The article upon which this recommendation is based won’t be published until January 2016 which makes these limitations much more critical. Osteoarthritis of the knee is the most common form of arthritis and can be seen as a normal part of aging and of “wear and tear” of the body. It occurs most often in people over age 50 and more often in women than in men. It’s degenerative, getting worse over time. With the aging of the US population, especially considering the crush of baby boomers, the subject of how best to manage the pain and disability seen with osteoarthritis of the knee becomes important.

423,423,"Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40s, Study Says",There’s no evidence of that. There was no evidence of any independent research to find independent experts to comment on the study. The answer gets at the heart of the methodology used – and whether it renders the research strong or questionable. That’s the end of the discussion? What?,false,"The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited. The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all. While this story begins telling readers that ""Another study…finds that screening can lower the risk of dying…"" –  look at how other competing stories began:   4th paragraph of AP story: ""The new study has major limitations and cannot account for possibly big differences in the groups of women it compares."" 1st paragraph of LA Times blog story:  ""Critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading."" 2nd sentence of NY Times story:  ""Results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit."" No such skepticism, no such independent critical evaluation took place in the HealthDay story. Women – especially in their 40s – must be terribly confused by the swirling studies. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November, the American Cancer Society and others’ backlash against it, the Norwegian study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and now the new Swedish study. This is when journalism must rise to the challenge with an extraordinary effort to help evaluate evidence, ask tough questions, and offer insightful analysis. That just didn’t happen with this story.

The release quotes a researcher saying, “This study demonstrated responses in five of 18 patients treated at MD Anderson, and many of the patients had significant reductions in their tumor size.” It also gives details of some of those treatment responses. That researcher, Padmanee Sharma, M.D., is also part of the anal cancer study team.",mixture,"As the nation’s largest cancer center, MD Anderson made a splash in 2012 with its ambitious announcement of a multi-billion dollar Moon Shots Program, which it called an unprecedented effort to rapidly convert scientific discoveries into life-saving advances. This news release, about a phase II clinical trial of the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) for one type of anal cancer, is decidedly more down to earth. The news release refrains from hype but still falls short of the mark when it comes to describing costs, potential harms, and comparisons with existing treatments. While calling results “encouraging,” the news release would be more helpful if it provided a meaningful assessment of whether this therapy might advance the Moon Shot’s directive of saving lives. Anal cancer is relatively rare. The American Cancer Society projects 8,080 new cases and 1,080 deaths in 2016. The number of new anal cancer cases has been rising. It is found mainly in older adults, with an average age in the early 60s. The risk of being diagnosed with anal cancer during one’s lifetime is about 1 in 500, with women at slightly higher risk. Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is the most common form of anal cancer and is linked to infection by the human papilloma virus (HPV), the same virus that causes cervical cancer. The chemotherapy and radiation protocols that have been used to treat anal cancer have remained little changed since the 1970s, and there is no FDA-approved chemotherapy drug specific to anal cancer, according to the HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation. In recent years, a new class of drugs called immunotherapy drugs that unleash the body’s own immune system to attack cancer have offered a potential alternative to traditional treatments for several types of cancer."

However, the story cites benefit numbers from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper without giving readers any information about the study or where those numbers came from. Providing more context on those benefit numbers would have made the story stronger. Osteoporosis is not uncommon. Estimates of osteoporosis occurrence (and severity) vary, but a 2014 study estimated that more than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone injuries, such as hip fractures, that can have significant impacts on a patient’s health and quality of life. A 2007 study estimated that 65 percent of women who develop osteoporosis, and 42 percent of men who develop osteoporosis, will suffer a bone fracture in their lifetime. In short, many people will have to make decisions about how to prevent or treat osteoporosis. If there are complicated issues surrounding widely-used treatment options — as is the case with bisphosphonates — there is real value in news stories that attempt to untangle those issues for readers. That also makes it particularly important for such stories to clearly address everything from the financial ties of expert sources to the quality of the evidence tied to health risks and benefits."

451,451,Quick brain scan could screen for autism,"Although it is clear that this technology is not yet available to the public, the story predicts the new scan ""could be ready for general use in a couple of years."" Really? Someone involved in this story – the reporter? It seems unlikely that any knowledgeable researcher would make such a wildly optimistic prediction on the basis of a 40-person study. The story didn’t exaggerate the prevalence or impact of autism.",mixture,"The enthusiasm this story effuses about a new brain scanning technology to diagnose autism may well be warranted. But it fails to give more than the most cursory of cautions about the early stage of this research and the tough road that lies ahead. The story makes it sound like we are a slam dunk away from seeing this test at the local radiology clinic. In reality, much larger studies with a much greater range of patients will be needed to tell whether the scan is effective enough to be widely used. Autism is difficult to diagnose due to its many different causes and symptoms and because it often occurs with other similar neurodevelopmental disorders. A fast and accurate diagnostic brain scan would take much of the uncertainty out of the diagnostic process and would hopefully speed treatment and other support services to patients."
452,452,Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain,"The “viniyoga” program may be less novel, but is distinctive nonetheless. Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain Group Health in Seattle did release a lengthy press release on this study. Members of the general public are legitimately concerned about chronic back pain and its consequences. It is not clear that the study conclusions apply to individuals with more severe back pain.",mixture,"An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions. The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions—that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention. But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling. So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems. Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows. The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities—and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn’t have access to this intervention. Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to “usual care”. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States. In the United States, back pain is the ninth most expensive medical condition for women, and the 10th for men, in terms of direct medical costs—with chronic back pain accounting for a disproportionate chunk of those expenses. And the costs of work absence and disability claims related to back pain vastly exceed the medical price tag. Though Americans spend almost $35 billion per year on the medical treatment of back pain, the prevalence of chronic back pain appears to be rising—and self-rated spinal health among Americans appears be declining. (See Soni, 2011; Freburger et al., 2008; and Martin et al., 2008). A number of nonsurgical treatments—analgesics, exercise, manual therapies, complementary/alternative therapies, psychological interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation—are modestly effective in the management of chronic back pain. Yet for various reasons, Americans overuse ineffective treatments and underuse effective ones. (See Carey et al., 2009). So the identification of treatments that facilitate recovery and are popular with patients is a key social and medical priority.

462,462,Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder,"The release doesn’t rely on unjustifiable language. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.” The release did say that larger, future trials will look at whether the benefits of cannabidiol can be achieved at lower, and perhaps less toxic doses. The FDA does, however, consider cannabidiol an investigational product for treating children with epilepsy and has “expanded access provisions” that allow its use. The release is timed with the publication of the trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine. Since the drug isn’t FDA approved, it’s too soon to know whether its cost will be covered by health insurance.",true,"This release from the NYU Langone Medical Center describes a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of children and adolescents with Dravet syndome, an extreme form of epilepsy, who often don’t respond to other drugs. The release provides a very good description of the benefits and the side effects that were reported from the trial. It adds cautions and nuance that are missing from many news releases. But not included were the cost of the new drug (projected to be quite steep) and we think the release could have emphasized more that the children in the trial were already on seizure medications. When the cannabidiol (or a placebo) was added to the maintenance drug it alleviated seizures but also introduced a high degree of side effects. A CNN story on the study, which we also reviewed, had many of the same strengths as the news release (overall depth and detail on benefits), but it similarly skipped cost information. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy that generally begins in a child’s first year but is a life-long condition, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Currently, treatments for this condition are marginal and new therapies addressing its symptoms would be welcome. The trial showed reduced seizures in this difficult-to-treat type of epilepsy compared to patients given a placebo. The lead researcher stressed that the study only tested cannabidiol in patients “with especially severe forms who have not responded to numerous medications”  and that the drug is not a panacea for other forms of epilepsy."

Chemotherapy has significant side effects and the survival benefit is small. As is currently done for breast cancer, to be able to predict whether the tumor is likely to return after surgery would help guide treatment decisions about chemotherapy. This story reports on new results on a gene test for colon cancer tumors to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. Unfortunately the new test was only modestly able to predict colon cancer recurrence and failed to predict response to chemotherapy. Future research is clearly needed. This story adequately represents the novelty and availability of the test. It does not engage in disease mongering and is clear on the target of the test – colon cancers that are large but have not spread beyond the colon. It quotes multiples sources and is clear to point out who is invested in the development of the test. The story could have been improved by describing what is currently done to determine need for chemotherapy (i.e. pathology and/or imaging tests), by providing the baseline average risk of recurrence as a comparison to the predicted risk from the  test, and by describing potential harms of the test. Finally, the story doesn’t really give any details on the current study or the overall strength of the evidence to support the use of the test. Although the story points out that the results will be presented at a meeting, it should have made the point that these studies are not rigorously peer-reviewed and evaluated prior to presentation, which makes it more difficult to evaluate the study at this time."

The release does a good job of describing the study methods and the conclusion that a modest increase of at least 48 minutes a week of moderately intense walking and walking-based strengthening exercises achieved significant, if not dramatic, decreases in average overall risk of major mobility disability over a two-year-plus period of time. It also paid appropriate attention to the “dose-dependent” benefits of the exercise regimen as compared to the control group’s health education classes. That is, the greater the increase in minutes of exercise, the greater the benefits on average overall. It also noted the researchers’ conclusion that although 150 minutes of exercise a week was the goal, seeing benefits at just 48 minutes does have implications for exercise compliance rates and the likelihood that even elderly couch potatoes might devote 15 minutes or so a few days a week to stay healthier. The release didn’t include any numbers summarizing and putting the results in context. It also would have been strengthened by including a more detailed description of what “sedentary” referred to. One notable inclusion was a paragraph devoted to weaknesses in the study. Bravo for that. As the U.S. population ages, increasing numbers of elderly signal their desire to live independently, and evidence for the benefits of consistent and persistent exercise grows, researchers, geriatricians and the public are clearly interested in identifying optimal and safe exercise regimens that people can do on their own, that don’t require gym memberships or expensive equipment, and that — most of all– that people will stick to over the long haul. For many over 70 or 75 years of age, even half an hour a day can seem overwhelming. Thus, research suggesting that 20 minutes a day of moderately intense walking (with or without ankle weights), stretching, and balance exercises is a reasonable goal. Studies designed to demonstrate with some confidence that even moderate exercise can contribute to reduced risk of disability are likely to attract interest among caregivers and the public."

478,478,"Health officials have seen a surge in the number of people using ""bug spray"" to get high.","The assertion that the additional chemical was some form of bug spray, and not merely another one of the hundreds of largely unknown chemicals being sold as synthetic marijuana, came from an emergency responder with the Indianapolis Fire Department who was quoted in that same March story: “Indianapolis firefighter Scott Lebherz told IndyStar this variation of KD can take many forms — marijuana, spice, tobacco, even banana leaves — but shares a common trait: all laced with a heavy-duty household bug spray.” We reached out to the Indianapolis Fire Department to ask how they reached the conclusion that the adulterating chemical in these cases was some form of insecticide. [Their symptoms were] indistinguishable from a lot of outbreaks that we’ve seen [that involved only] synthetic cannabinoids.” “The idea that this is somehow unique or different from the clinical effects of the synthetic cannabinoids alone [has not been demonstrated], at least so far,” Rusyniak said. In reality, no evidence establishes such an “alarming trend,” because only one of the three incidents cited by the Daily Mail involved a confirmed case of a person using an insecticide intentionally as a form of recreational drug. It bears mentioning that a number of drugs, including methamphetamine on its own, can produce similarly bizarre or violent reactions in users. The Mail was able to do by capitalizing on the flaws and ambiguities inherent in the original local news reports — a prime example of the local news-Daily Mail misinformation complex.",false,"There are two cases, though only one has been confirmed, in which a crystallized form of bug spray is alleged to have been added to methamphetamine, and these events resulted in symptoms consistent with an aggressive methamphetamine high. The final case, in contrast, involved the unconfirmed assertion that bug spray, in liquid form, was sprayed to synthetic marijuana (to enhance the high or perhaps throw drug dogs off the scent) and resulted in symptoms consistent with a synthetic marijuana overdose. The collection of these three events does not coherently create a narrative that can be considered an “alarming trend,” but because at least one credible report documents a case in which someone intentionally injected Raid (mixed with methamphetamine), we rank the assertion of a surge in the number of people using “bug spray” to get high as mostly false."

It offers readable explanations of how these researchers are modifying gene delivery strategies to overcome tragic problems uncovered by earlier clinical studies that led to a wholesale halt in work with humans. But the bottom line here is that nearly all of the promising research of the present has been conducted in mice, making the enthusiasm that permeates this story premature. Instead of deeply discussing the challenges in moving from animal data into medical interventions, the story spends more time on the growing financial interest among investors. The first quote in the story is from a venture capitalist, for example. While it’s important to discuss the biotech buzz surrounding gene therapy research, it’s also important to provide clarity on how challenging it will be to turn the research into actual treatments, even when experiments are amply funded.

While steroid injections take about five minutes and are usually done in a physician’s office once every six weeks or more, dry needling is usually performed by a physical therapist and requires more frequent treatments of about 20 minutes apiece. Dry needling might be more convenient than steroid injections if it’s part of treatment strategy that also involves physical therapy. There’s no discussion of costs for either steroid injections or dry needling.",mixture,"This news release from an orthopedics journal relates a study finding that dry needling, which uses filament needles to stimulate trigger points in the muscles, is just as effective as cortisone injections when it comes to reducing pain and swelling caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), a common hip condition. We applaud its restrained tone but would have liked to get a sense of how much symptom improvement patients experienced during the six-week trial as well as a discussion of costs and availability of these two treatment options. This release says the effectiveness of steroid injections “is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.” To conclude that dry needling is “not inferior” to a treatment that isn’t very effective doesn’t say much. There is no slam-dunk treatment for chronic hip pain. But if it comes with low risk and a modest cost, dry needling might be an alternative to steroids for combating chronic pain. Also, dry needling might offer an option for patients who haven’t felt relief from steroids or are precluded from taking them due to medication interactions. As the release states, GTPS is very common and at times very painful. A safe, successful treatment that rapidly resolves pain (beyond normal natural healing) would benefit many individuals.

However, in sum, the story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress. Tackling the efficacy of therapy animals is a challenging subject, given that the story evaluates an absence of conclusive evidence. However, it’s an important subject. For example, therapy dogs can be expensive, which means a family may spend a great deal of money on a therapy animal — with little idea of whether the animal will provide meaningful benefits for a patient. Limited resources are available to help patients dealing with mental health issues, and it is important to ensure that those resources are used to achieve the maximum possible benefit.

567,567,Gastric Balloon in a Pill Helps Patients Lose Weight Without Surgery or Endoscopy,"Generally speaking, results presented at scientific conferences should be interpreted very carefully because they haven’t undergone peer review. Whereas the Eprise gastric balloon pill would be available to those with a BMI of 27 and above, according to the release, it is not a permanent weight-loss solution. It could be more than the gastric balloons already on the market due to the use of new technology or it could be less since it is less invasive than surgery. The release states that the manufacturer is “studying what it says is the first procedureless gastric balloon. Not exactly a bargain then?",mixture,"This release describes a new type of gastric balloon being developed that is inserted via a pill rather than through endoscopy. The interim study on the device was presented at an obesity medical conference and has not been peer-reviewed. The approach appears to be novel; a capsule containing a collapsed balloon is swallowed, then filled with water via a small attached catheter that remains outside the patient’s mouth. After four months, a valve on the balloon opens and the balloon deflates and is excreted by the body. The small patient group (34 volunteers) in the study lost an average of 22 pounds after four months. The device’s main advantage is that it is non-invasive (except for a small catheter which some could find uncomfortable) but the release is based on data that has not been peer-reviewed or published. The release played down the limited evidence base and possible harms and neglected costs. Obesity appears to be a problem that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says America, at least, appears stuck in unhealthy lifestyle paterns. One-in-three Americans is obese. Obesity is a leading contributor to dozens of other health conditions. As a result, millions of people turn to  gastric bypass, and the less intrusive (and less effective) gastric balloon and other medical procedures to try to lose weight when other methods fail. It seems the more effective the procedure is in taking off the weight, the more complications arise. The Eprise gastric balloon pill described in the release claims to be as effective but less intrusive as current methods.

597,597,Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner,"It describes prostate cancer as “the most common cancer afflicting U.S. men.” That’s true, if you don’t count skin cancer. Current treatment options include watchful waiting, active surveillance, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. The news release provides perspective, stating that the research “uses a novel analytical approach to screen numerous plant-based chemicals instead of testing a single agent as many studies do, discovering specific combinations that shrink prostate cancer tumors.” The claim of novelty seems appropriate regarding the approach to screening. Furthermore, the release touts the potential benefit of these dietary factors: “These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body.”  However, it is a huge leap to think even if these compounds could reduce inflammation to a clinically important degree that it would also provide better cancer control. Treatment options completely depend upon the stage of the cancer–thus range from conservative management to aggressive attempts at curative therapy to palliative care.",false,"This news release attempts to translate preliminary research on plant chemicals into actionable dietary advice. Bad move. Researchers used an innovative screening strategy to cull through 142 natural compounds to identify a combination of three phytochemicals — found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and red grapes — that inhibited the growth of implanted prostate tumors in mice. Their work is described in the online journal Precision Oncology. But it’s a big leap from the lab table to the dinner table, where the release says that by indulging in certain foods, you can “enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving — or even preventing — cancer.” Nowhere does it warn that studies of cell lines or animals don’t prove a human benefit. Combinations of plant chemicals have become a focus of cancer research, driven by their relative safety, low cost, and wide availability. Lab studies have found substances in plants can reduce inflammation, stimulate the immune system, protect and repair normal cells, and slow the growth of cancer cells, among other things. But research on the effects of these substances to fight specific cancers is still in its infancy, and most experts advise eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for better health. Prostate cancer is an area where men feel particularly vulnerable because it’s widespread — about 3 million American men are living with prostate cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute — and there are few actionable steps for prevention. Suggesting a simple solution — such as eating a few specific foods — may give men a false sense of security."

Other details were needed, too: how old the children were; what kind of neurosurgery they had; and what the major limitations of the study were. More significantly, because the article does not specify in any real detail what kinds of surgeries were performed on the study group, it is difficult for readers to compare alternatives. And thus the statement in the lead that brain surgery in the study group can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure free after one year will be difficult for readers to put into perspective. Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery.",true,"This article describes results of a randomized trial of neurosurgical procedures designed to eliminate seizures in children under 18 years of age whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy. Importantly, the story notes significant side effects attributable to the surgeries, and the struggle to receive insurance coverage. Yet, readers will likely want more information about the study–for example, how old the children were, and what kind of neurosurgery they had. Editor’s note: After initial publication of this review, we changed the rating under Quantify Benefits from Not Satisfactory to Satisfactory. The star rating was changed from 3 stars to 4 stars. This also affected the headline, which we have since updated. See the related criterion below. Surgical approaches to intractable seizure disorders — with some children and adults experiencing hundreds of significant seizures a day — have been shown to improve quality of life and maintain cognitive health, particularly in young children for whom brain plasticity is stronger than in adults. Thus, clinical trials to better clarify both the benefits and the harms of such surgeries worldwide are important in improving the evidence base for these procedures."

It is true that, done correctly, yoga is not likely to produce significant injuries. However, the subjects in the study were not supervised nor was their positioning for each of the poses determined. Dr. Fishman invested a ‘significant chunk’ of his own money into the research and we appreciate that the story put that financial interest out in the open.",true,"This is a thorough and balanced report of research into the effects of yoga on bone density. While yoga provides a range of potential health benefits including increased flexibility, balance and strength (all factors which can help prevent falls and fractures), the researchers focused specifically on whether a 12 minute per day yoga routine could increase bone density. Although improvements were found after a decade of research, helpful caveats about the limitations of the study (lack of a control group, self-reported nature of the study) kept it away from the realm of exaggeration. Yoga is hugely popular and growing in importance, so understanding the specific effects of daily practice of yoga could influence current thinking about its role in disease prevention and health promotion. If a specific effect of yoga on bone density is likely then possibly reducing fracture risk through daily yoga practice could be a viable alternative to ingesting bisphosphonate drugs.

Cachexia is a serious condition typified by chronic weight loss that can affect a patient’s nutritional status and ability to undergo or continue treatment. Striking those with chronic diseases, it weakens patients and in some cases can hasten their demise. If it could be thwarted by compounds from spices, that would represent a real boon.

676,676,Worried About Dementia? You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure,"(Why not wait for that, to make this story meatier?) Worried About Dementia? You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure The story makes it clear that the news “hook” is new research to be presented at the Alzheimer’s Association meeting. The story strongly suggets that people should take blood pressure medication to lower their risk of dementia. Unlike what the story said, it is not as simple and carefree as taking “a pill… to help keep [your] brain healthy and sharp.” The story, as noted earlier, is based on comments from the director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.",mixture,"This NPR report built around exhortations to control blood pressure by the head of a federal health agency draws attention to the long-documented links between hypertension and some forms of dementia. For many, many reasons, diagnosing and treating high blood pressure are good ideas for maintaining health and preventing strokes and heart disease, and the better news is that there are dozens of drugs and lifestyle changes available — some of them very inexpensive — to help people do so. But this story doesn’t explain that the evidence for an association between high blood pressure and vascular dementia, much less Alzheimer’s disease, is so far mostly observational. And perhaps more significantly, the story carries no data at all to support even the claims or strengths/weaknesses of the association. This NPR story missed an opportunity to offer the data and help the public understand more about risk assessment and probabilities of disease related to blood pressure. And it may mislead people into thinking that if they pop a pressure pill each day, they will avoid Alzheimer’s Disease. That’s unproven."
677,677,A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy,"A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy Would this be a relatively inexpensive treatment? Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.” The description does offer some numbers, but does it adequately “quantify the benefits”? A costly one? Here’s a line from the Aug. 16 news release issued by the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI), where the relevant clinical trials were conducted: “This follow up study was initially funded by MCRI and the Australian Food Allergy Foundation.",false,"The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts. A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a “cure” for peanut allergies — such as the story we are reviewing here — would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What’s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment. The word “cure” should never be used hastily, something we just pointed out about a different TIME story last week. The NIH states that “peanut allergy is a growing health problem for which no treatment or cure exists. People living with peanut allergy, and their caregivers, must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter to avoid allergic reactions, which can be severe and even life-threatening.” A 2010 study stated that 1.4 percent of people in the U.S. report having an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts. In short, peanut allergy poses very real risks for those with peanut allergies, and can pose a particular challenge for parents of children with peanut allergies — who have to maintain constant vigilance regarding the possibility of peanut contamination in places where their kids eat, play or attend school. As a result, new research findings related to addressing peanut allergies garner a lot of attention. This story may leave readers with more questions than answers."

This is worth noting. Since many surgeons and oncologists base their advise to patients on these recommendations, patients may soon be offered this less extensive surgery option. Breast-cancer study questions lymph node removal Because breast cancer is often diagnosed at an early stage, some doctors & patients prefer longer term follow-up than five years.",true,"Room for improvement:  Readers would have benefited from early clarity that all participants in the study still had a sentinel lymph node biopsy and that the research focused on whether removal of all lymph nodes was necessary if the sentinel nodes were cancerous. There was no discussion of cost impact of the findings, or about whether insurance might curtail coverage of lymph node dissection. There was no discussion of the researchers’ admission of what could be potentially important limitations in the research. The story didn’t explain how often complications of lymph node dissection occur. Women who have an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following a diagnosis of breast cancer, sometimes develop infections at the surgery site or lymphedema. Depending on its severity, lymphedema can be painful, disfiguring, and expensive to treat. While the symptoms of lymphedema can be treated, especially if caught early, once a person develops lymphedema, the person is always at risk for a recurrence of the lymphedema. If ALND confers no mortality or disease-free survival benefit, it may no longer be recommended as standard treatment for women with T1 or T2 breast cancer with positive nodes as determined by sentinel lymph node dissection."
692,692,Hip resurfacing aimed at boomers,"Hip resurfacing aimed at boomers 2007;89:16-20.] The news article cites three orthopedic surgeons, including one who is a spokesperson for the leading orthopedic medical society in the U.S. The article states that the first hip resurfacing system was approved by the FDA last spring and that competitors’ systems are in trials. Experts say the implant alone costs four to five times as much as a traditional hip implant—about $12,000 versus $2500 to $3000.",mixture,"The AP news story does a nice job of explaining what hip resurfacing is and how it fits into the history of hip replacement procedures. It summarizes the current availability of hip resurfacing in the US. However, the story provides virtually no evidence on the efficacy of resurfacing to support the mostly glowing testimonials of the three surgeons it quotes. According to the news article, the FDA “cited studies showing the Birmingham Hip resurfacer lasted at least five years…” What sorts of studies did the FDA analyze? What about the rest of the outcomes that patients value—such as improvements in pain and activity? Are there any randomized trials that compare similar patients who have undergone resurfacing with patients who have undergone total hip replacement? Is there follow-up beyond five years? These questions remain unanswered. The discussion of harms is likewise incomplete. The news article points out that hip resurfacing isn’t for everyone, and mentions two groups in whom it might not be appropriate. But the available research suggests the picture may be more complicated. There is disagreement about whether the procedure impairs the blood supply to bone or generates so much heat that it could cause the death of thigh bone. Bone death (necrosis of the femoral head) is a devastating complication for which there is currently no good solution. Other studies suggest additional potential problems. (For references and more details on potential harms, see “Harms of Treatment” above.) Although it is true that some researchers have found few problems with the devices and reported great success, readers deserve to know where the uncertainties lie. Perhaps the greatest uncertainty has to do with how long the implants will hold up. Though sufficient for FDA approval, survival of “at least five years” is not a strong endorsement. Total joint replacement, by comparison, has a track record extending 15 to 25 years. A closer look at the evidence might have reshaped the take-home message from this news report."

Though it is gratifying to hear the patient’s words and the hope that this treatment has provided him, it actually isn’t clear whether the hyperbaric oxygen itself was the reason he got better. The “placebo” effect is well described in the medical literature and refers to sham treatments (fake surgery or pills) leading to benefit. It may also be that the treatment really did help but not for the reasons cited–maybe simply sitting still for hours helped tissues to heal. We do wish the story had explored this aspect more. Overuse of unproven medical technologies poses risks to patients and adds to rising healthcare costs.

705,705,FDA authorizes marketing of first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults,"These findings suggest that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI. It also quotes an official who says the test “can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.” The FDA states that the blood test is a first of its kind to be approved for marketing. That isn’t the same as conducting a randomized clinical trial on the blood test, and that’s not explained in the news release. There is no outward disease-mongering but the information about deaths from TBI seemed a bit over-the-top since the population targeted by this test have potential mild TBI which would be unlikely to kill. The release does a good job describing the results of a multi-center prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product’s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results.",mixture,"The Food and Drug Administration approved for marketing a blood test that uses the presence of certain proteins to predict whether adults with a suspected concussion have structural brain injury, and which could conceivably reduce the number of people who undergo costlier computed tomography (CT) scans. The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Its anticipated that knowing these levels can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which don’t. We wish the release had included the research institutions involved and any publications relating to the study so that we could evaluate the evidence. This evidence was also missing from a CNN story we also reviewed on the test. There were approximately 2.8 million traumatic brain injury (TBI) visits to the emergency department in 2013, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and of these, TBI contributed to the deaths of 50,000 people.The release predicts that about one-third of patients may be able to forego CT scans because of this test’s predictive value. While the blood test reportedly has high sensitivity and specificity, logistical issues may lead doctors to do the test and continue to scan. Emergency department doctors may not be able to wait at least 3-4 hours for the blood test results since this would impact other workflows. News releases about concussion are bound to get a lot of attention. In this case, the news release doesn’t clearly spell out to lay readers what this test does. It’s not a test for concussion, as a casual reader might glean from the way it’s worded."

710,710,"Ecstasy could be ‘breakthrough’ therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD","Ecstasy could be ‘breakthrough’ therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD Since the drug of interest—MDMA—is banned in the US as a Schedule 1 substance, cost estimates may be unreliable. More emphasis on the nature and quality of evidence would be an important addition here. Drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil are mentioned, along with more traditional talk therapy. The hook for this story is really the recent FDA classification of MDMA as a “breakthrough therapy,” which puts it on a faster track for review (and often a lower bar of evidence is required).",true,"Post-traumatic stress disorder is difficult to treat. Over the course of the past decade, evidence has been accumulating that the compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as ecstasy, may be more effective than current drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil. This story, jump-started by a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration to classify MDMA as a “breakthrough drug,” which allows it to be evaluated and possibly approved more quickly, offers the reader a well-written account of the evolution of MDMA from a bad actor to a potentially efficacious one. An important element of the narrative is the dominant role of a nonprofit organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is dedicated to ending government bans on psychedelic substances and marijuana and has funded virtually all of the extant research on MDMA’s impact on PTSD sufferers. While the story is well-sourced, the text fails to explore this conflict of interest. It also may land too heavily on the side of “probable” rather than “possible.” The headline—Ecstasy could be “breakthrough” therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD—is worded conditionally but clearly heralds the dawn of a new age. Given the long clinical trial road ahead, despite MDMA’s “breakthrough” status designation, much could change. The substance MDMA may meet all evidentiary challenges and emerge at some point in the future as an effective part of the treatment regimen for PTSD. But drumming up enthusiasm for the drug before it is officially available, as this story may do, runs the risk of sending PTSD sufferers to a less safe—and certainly illegal—form: Ecstasy."

The story mentions this was a mouse study and acknowledges it isn’t the only potential avenue under study to arrest those harmful substances. However, it gives an overly optimistic spin, using the word “promising” and playing up a speculative comment in a UT Southwestern Medical Center news release that dementia cases “could drop by half” if there’s a vaccine that delays the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years. The story also doesn’t caution that success in animals often doesn’t translate to benefits in humans, and that other treatments targeting these proteins have not panned out. Also missing: discussions of costs and potential harms and comments from independent sources. As the U.S. population ages, dementia is becoming more common. Millions of families are coping with a person who has a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Available treatments do not prevent or cure Alzheimer’s and at best slow down the progression of symptoms for short periods. Considerable effort has focused on new treatments that seek to break down or prevent the deposition of abnormal proteins that appear to increase as memory loss progresses. So far these new treatments have not been shown to help. Initially they were tried in individuals with advanced disease but now are being used in patients with mild symptoms as a way to prevent progression. Even here, trials have not shown positive results that are clinically meaningful. A vaccine to “prevent” Alzheimer’s is appealing in that it works even earlier in the process, maybe even before symptoms appear. However, it isn’t clear that a vaccine will actually improve clinical outcomes. The fact that this small study in mice led to several optimistic headlines — not just USA Today’s — reflects how desperate we are for progress. Regardless, news stories should not make a remedy sound closer and more certain than it is."

Midwifery can fill an important need for wider access to care for pregnant women. Advocates for midwives say they reduce unnecessary care, cost less, and lead to great patient satisfaction. Still, news releases should stress the need for ongoing research to assess how the use of midwives affects pregnancy outcomes. The research report describes the study’s context well, noting that at this stage in the evolution of midwifery care in Canada, a randomized trial could not be supported based on the limited evidence that midwifery care is at least as good as traditional care.

It should also have given readers some of the context available in documents posted online by the FDA, Pfizer and other sources about the state of the science regarding this drug. On the plus side, the story makes clear that this drug is meant for a small and very specific group of patients. It also is clear about the high cost of the therapy.

In this study, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness and headaches were more common in the treatment group, though in most cases, the difference was small.

Candesartan works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes blood vessels and this lowers blood pressure. There is evidence of disease mongering in this story: The classification of “prehypertension” (systolic 130-139 mm Hg and 85-89 mm Hg diastolic) is still debatable by some medical experts, and whether prehypertension alone is a strong predictor of future heart disease is also debatable. Blood pressure increases as a natural part of aging, so whether prehypertension or mild hypertension should be viewed as a condition or disease and treated with costly medication needs further study. Hypertension is only one of several risk factors that contributes to heart disease. A prehypertensive or mildly hypertensive person with low risk factors and a healthy lifestyle may not benefit from drug treatment as much as someone with greater risk of heart disease and an unhealthy behaviors, such as a poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking.

A reduced sodium diet may help control hypertension, but reducing water will not help most people decrease blood pressure. There is not much quantitative information on the risk reduction from taking an ARB to prevent hypertension. There was some modest protective benefit in the treatment group at 4 years (absolute reduction 9.8%), though the story says those who took the drug for 2 years and then a placebo for an additional 2 years “matched the placebo group”. There is no discussion of the side effects of this anti-hypertensive drug, nor is there discussion of long-term safety of taking this medication for many years as a means of prevention. The most common side effects of ARBs are cough, elevated potassium levels, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, abnormal taste sensation (metallic or salty taste), and rash. In this study, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness and headaches were more common in the treatment group, though in most cases, the difference was small. This class of drugs are typically more expensive than other anti-hypertensive medications, but there is no mention of the cost of taking this medication daily for prevention of hypertension. Also, there is no comparison of ARB treatment with less costly anti-hypertensive medications such a diuretics, or a cost comparison with lifestyle modification. Lastly, the story appropriately notes that the makers of the candesartan sponsored and help design the study. What is not mentioned is that the lead author also serves as a consultant to the drug company and has other grant support from AstraZeneca, the makers of the drug."

762,762,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said or argued to the effect that ""taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.","As such, it is accurate to claim that Warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex-reassignment surgeries, as they do other treatments and services, under those programs. “A second federal court agreed. In May 2019, HHS under President Donald Trump proposed another new rule that would largely reverse the Section 1557 expansions brought by the Obama administration, removing gender identity and pregnancy termination from the definition of sex discrimination. HHS’s proposed reinterpretation of Section 1557 rolls back critical nondiscrimination protections, allowing health insurance companies to refuse to cover and health care providers to deny health services to transgender people, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, and to those who have had or are seeking an abortion. The department wrote in a press release: “In 2016, HHS issued a new rule that redefined discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity which it defined as one’s internal sense of being ‘male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.’ In response to a subsequent lawsuit by several states and healthcare entities, on December 31, 2016, a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule’s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis, finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.",true,"What's true: Warren has repeatedly expressed support for sex-reassignment therapy being covered under taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, and Tricare, as well as state Medicaid programs.

There is one error in the article: “People who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.” Presumably they meant that people starting treatment in 2003 are EXPECTED to live 13 yrs longer. The story provides appropriate prevalence and incidence data on Americans living with HIV. If anything, the story under-reports HIV prevalence worldwide. The story might have aked the question: If this therapy is approved, would it be made available to the millions infected with HIV in developing countries?

In particular, it does a wonderful and economical job summarizing the benefits of the drugs being studied. It provides the numbers in both absolute and relative terms, for example. But it skimps on some of the details, chiefly the costs of the drugs, that the funder of the study makes one of the drugs in question, and whether the drugs are experimental or on the market. Osteoporosis is a well-known risk factor for fracture, especially among older women. It can also be screened for with x-rays that measure bone density. A number of different treatments exist for individuals with osteoporosis and this news release presents data from a published study in JAMA. For most individuals with osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements are recommended if dietary consumption isn’t adequate. First-line medications to decrease fracture risk is a group called the bisphosphonates. These medicines have been around for several decades and are usually taken by mouth on a weekly basis or by injection once a year. For individuals who are at particularly high risk, including those who have had a fracture while taking a bisphosphonate, second-line therapy is considered. These medicines include teriparatides that are given as a daily injection under the skin. The current study compares a new version of this class of drug, abaloparatide, to placebo and teriparatide. As a related editorial highlights, there are a number of effective medicines to prevent fractures in those with osteoporosis and they are probably under-used. For most individuals, use of existing oral medicines should be the focus of initial treatment. The current study focuses on giving patients who didn’t respond to the initial therapy or other high risk individuals another option."

778,778,'Universal' blood test for earlier diagnosis of cancer moves closer to market,It’s unclear what the 93% success rate means in this context. What is the false positive rate? Is that the sensitivity? The release states that a modified version of the original test can identify individuals with cancer more than 93% of the time. Ideally the release would have explained that a prospective trial is still needed.,false,"Blood tests have become a popular study focus among scientists seeking mechanisms for early detection of cancer. Researchers have come up with a number of tests in recent years that examine a variety of components of blood, among them types of blood cells, proteins, and the presence of mutated DNA. Most of the tests are specific to particular cancers and vary in their levels of accuracy. In this release, a team at the University of Bradford heralds the increasing accuracy of a test that measures the response of white blood cells exposed to ultraviolet light. The test, called TumorScan, uses an automated cell reader designed by a Paris-based company, IMSTAR, to examine thousands of cells from any one sample, and the researchers say that they have found the process can detect the presence of any type of cancer with more than 90% success. IMSTAR has now licensed the university team’s technology and plans to bring the text to market some time in the future. The release touts the potential benefits without addressing some real concerns: Technology like this is enabling us to find more and more cancers at an earlier stage, but we are often unable to differentiate between the ones that need to be treated and those that can be monitored or ignored. While the news release didn’t need to go into great detail about this, it should at least acknowledge the downsides. Finding cancer at an early stage via a blood test may improve survival rates, and reduce the need for invasive biopsies. However, it’s important to keep in mind that all cancer screening tests carry the risks of false-positives, false-negatives and overdiagnosis and treatment of non-growing or slow-growing cancer."

Although the story raises some red flags with its emphasis on surrogate markers and overgeneralizing who might would be a candidate for treatment, these are deficiencies that we address in other sections of the review. In addition, more patients died in the drug treatment group compared with the placebo group, although the story erroneously states that the opposite was the case.",false,"This was an overly enthusiastic account of a study on an experimental new drug called anacetrapib that lowers bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol. The study was designed to look primarily at the safety of the drug and not whether it prevented heart attacks. But that didn’t prevent the story from making some wildly positive statements about the likely benefits of treatment. The story stumbles out of the gate with an over-the-top prediction about how the drug “may conquer heart disease.”  It continues to lay on the hype with quotes about the “incredible” results and how the drug could be “the perfect new treatment for all people at risk of a heart attack.” We realize some of this enthusiasm came from the mouths of experts but we know there are many who would be far more cautious and we didn’t hear from them in the story. It closes with an erroneous description of how many people died in the study. Needless to say, not what we hope to see on the front page of the nation’s highest-circulating daily. By comparison, look at how NPR closed their online story: “Still there were four deaths from cardiovascular causes among the 800 patients taking Merck’s drug compared with just one among the same number in the the just-released trial results. So don’t count Merck’s drug approved just yet.” (Please note: we reviewed the first version of each story that we found – not any subsequent versions the news orgs may have published. In fact, the version we reviewed doesn’t even appear online anymore.) It would nice if preventing heart attacks was just a matter of lowering bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. However, research increasingly suggests that it isn’t as simple as that. Drugs that lower bad cholesterol through one mechanism do appear to be effective, but drugs that lower it another way may not offer the same protection. Similarly, people with naturally high good cholesterol seem to have a low risk of heart attacks, but not every drug that raises good cholesterol has cardiovacular benefits. (In fact, another experimental drug that raises good cholesterol was shown recently to increase the risk of heart attacks.) So far, the drug discussed in this story doesn’t appear to have the same problems as its good cholesterol-raising predecessor, but at this early stage of development we simply don’t know if it works. Larger studies might show that the drug has safety problems that haven’t shown up in this study. Or it might turn out that the drug is safe but doesn’t offer much protection. Some drugs even get approved only to later be recalled because of rare but serious adverse effects that aren’t apparent until millions of people start taking the medicine. This is all a way of saying that caution is required when a drug is this early in its development. There are any number of ways that it could get derailed prior to reaching the market, and so journalists have to take care not get too caught up in the excitement."

785,785,Portable device detects severe stroke in seconds with 92 percent accuracy,"The real comparison would be comparing this device to CT scans given that mobile CT scanners are increasingly being used in ambulances. This news release only mentions the specificity of the test, even though the actual study it was summarizing reports that “the VIPS device was able to differentiate severe stroke from minor strokes with a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 83 to 98), specificity of 92% (95% CI 75 to 99)… and differentiate severe stroke from all other subjects with a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 83 to 98), specificity of 87% (95% CI 81 to 92), and an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.96).” However, we should remember that diagnostic tests need to demonstrate that they offer a benefit beyond the current standard of care and that using them would improve patient outcomes. We learn that this is very preliminary research and that the researchers will do another study to “determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists.” The device itself is new technology so it earns a Satisfactory for the novelty claim. Portable device detects severe stroke in seconds with 92 percent accuracy Putting CT scanners in ambulances has been tried and seems to be (at least preliminarily) successful.",mixture,"With a suspected stroke, speed matters. If this device described in the release, called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS), could help emergency personnel determine where to take patients with suspected stroke for treatment (a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center) then it might be very valuable. The release describes a published study on the VIPS diagnostic tool showing that it can accurately detect large-vessel occlusion (a blockage or closing of a blood vessel) in patients with suspected stroke yet it misses some of the key features you’d expect with a news release talking about a new diagnostic tool, especially its cost, and its accuracy measured against other methods, such as a mobile CT scan, to differentiate strokes. If care could be improved by a speedier, easy to use device which helps decide whether endovascular therapy (a procedure used to treat problems affecting the blood vessels) is necessary this could well improve outcomes for stroke patients. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Mount Sinai, the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center and elsewhere published a study in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery suggesting that their device (a visor worn by emergency personnel) called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) was better at identifying patients with large-vessel occlusions than a standard physical examination. This matters because if the device passes all the other tests we expect of diagnostic tools including showing it’s sufficiently sensitive and specific and an improvement over other methods, then it could more quickly route patients to stroke centers that have endovascular capabilities and have a large impact on the outcome of patients."

Other tests using saliva are in use today and could offer a general comparison point to suggest the costs of a new test. Even an accurate positive finding could cause harm, since it would inform people about their risk of a future condition without giving them the ability to do much about it.",false,"This nugget of a story, while nicely written and easy to read, puts too much emphasis on the promise of new findings and not enough on the actual data involved in the study. Research by the University of Alberta in Canada looked at the composition of saliva from three groups of people — Alzheimer’s patients, people with mild cognitive impairment, and those whose mental skills were normal for their age. An analysis of the saliva from these three distinct groups showed specific differences in certain compounds present. The story suggests that the findings could form the basis of “a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.” But the story offers few if any specifics about the size or design of the study, its limitations, or the actual results of the investigation. While a competing HealthDay story took pains to point out the tentative nature of the study, this Time piece gives readers a cursory and overly optimistic view of its potential. Alzheimer’s dementia is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent condition in our aging society. If the described simple, non-invasive screening test is truly effective (which will take much more testing to find out), it could have an enormous impact that is potentially positive if we develop better treatments for Alzheimer’s patients and can take action based on the results. There is also potential for negative impact resulting from false positive and false negative results, and from knowing about a frightening diagnosis without having the ability to do anything about it."

While the column does a nice job of pointing out some of the limitations of the studies included in the review and highlights the fact the review authors cannot make a recommendation for the dosage or preparation, it missed the mark on a few key points. For instance, there was no discussion of costs, (which seems like an important omission, as many readers will want to try the over-the-counter products), there was little mention of the adverse effects of zinc, and there was no commentary from an independent expert. Although most of us view the common cold as a mere nuisance, the infection can have serious clinical and economic impact. The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 million is spent annually in the US for over-the-counter remedies.

The release does not commit disease-mongering. This would have been an opportune place to add that not smoking — or quitting smoking, if you are a smoker — is probably the most important thing one can do to reduce the risk of lung cancer.",mixture,"This release reports on an NIH-funded study to determine if the use of the drug metformin by diabetic patients may affect their risk of developing lung cancer. The overall answer is that it does not, but the release takes five paragraphs to say that. Instead, it focuses on a very small subset of patients who had never smoked and whose lung cancer risk appeared to be lower than never-smokers who didn’t take metformin. By trumpeting findings from that subgroup — and burying the main results of the study, which were negative — this release misrepresents the research findings and misleads its readers. We’d suggest that the findings of this study probably did not warrant the spotlight provided by a news release. But if a news release is to be issued, it should lead with the results for the primary outcome and give second billing to provocative but preliminary findings from subgroups. While not as egregious as another example of subgroup “spin” that we recently reported on, this news release will certainly give readers the impression that there’s something special about metformin when it comes to preventing cancer in people with diabetes, when that hasn’t been established with any certainty. Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long-term use of drugs such as metformin. Some research suggests that metformin may decrease the risk of lung cancer — making the results of this study an important addition to the scientific literature. Unfortunately, the release focuses almost entirely on the results seen in a small subgroup of patients. As such, it doesn’t accurately reflect the totality of the research in question.

It may be that, if and once there’s an available product, costs for each screening visit can be reduced.",false,"Nowhere do we hear how far along the research is. The main section doesn’t even allude to evidence, other than to state that more research is to be done, which is true about most everything in medicine except limes for scurvy. As far as a reader can tell, the “new portable scanner” may have yet to leave a laboratory setting. All we know is that it’s been submitted to, and is a finalist for, an engineering & technology award. It’s not the same as clinical research. The article is quick to point out mammography’s low detection rates (sensitivity, perhaps?) in younger women, identifying the problem to be solved, but it never tells us the detection rates for the new tool.

But from the structure of this article, focusing on technology but not evidence, a reader could only conclude the new kid on the block is superior. If we’re lucky, the new kid will make the world a better place. But filing a patent for a device is not the same level of proof as clinical research. People would be shocked to learn how many promising ideas from labs and napkins never survive clinical trials, how many prove to be worse for mankind than what we already do. Science is hard and complex. Last year’s uproar over the new mammography guidelines highlighted that there are important subtleties about screening for cancer, and that clear, balanced communication is crucial. It may sound like we ask a lot of journalists. But really, asking one more question would’ve turned this story around: How far along is this idea? The answer leads us to look beyond the novelty, beyond the theoretical benefits, beyond the entangled claims of the institution and inventor who stand to benefit, and see, simply, whether this idea is better or worse or needs 4 more years in the oven before we can even ask. Mammography isn’t perfect, and an improved screening technique for breast cancer could reduce pain, suffering, and death for many women. But that need doesn’t give journalists a license to hype."

Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice tumeric. The news release doesn’t disclose any harms and quantitative data to back up its claims and, instead, uses only broad, ambiguous language when describing the treatment’s benefits. For example, researchers found that these molecules may induce “substantial” cell death in neuroblastoma cells without being toxic to healthy cells. The study’s limitations should have been emphasized — namely, that it’s early pre-clinical research with experiments only conducted in undefined cell lines. In addition, research with curcumin-loaded nanoparticles isn’t exactly new. In 2012, a couple of studies looked at the molecule’s effects, including its toxicity, on neuroblastoma cells. Many news releases cover research that is in its pre-clinical phases. This is fair game, of course, but we then expect these reports to caution readers on the treatment’s applicability to clinical medicine. In other words, treatments that are successful in cell lines and animal models usually do not translate to effective clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it also takes years, maybe decades, before a treatment is even ready for clinical trials — a process often referred to as “from bench to bedside.” To avoid giving patients false hope, news releases need to disclose the early nature of the research high up in the release as well as be more explicit in detailing the treatment’s development and timeline."

It does not warn that self-reported improvements are likely to be biased by the patient’s expectation of benefit from the program.",false,"This is a news release about an update of a small 2014 study on a program to reverse cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The program includes as many as 36 interventions which must be followed. Right out of the starting gate the release misinforms by using the terms mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease interchangeably. They are not the same. The study reports “unprecedented” improvement in 10 patients with “early Alzheimer’s (AD) or its precursors” who adhered to the protocol, dubbed “metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration,” or MEND, for five to 24 months. All but one of the patients had genes (APOE) associated with Alzheimer’s. The news release provides data on just three of the cases in the study and does not discuss costs or potential challenges of adhering to this protocol.

Moreover, researchers say their findings are strong enough to warrant widespread genetic testing so those at risk for the disease can receive preventive measures. The book deal and the recommendation of genetic testing are troubling since there are just a handful of case studies to back up the program. Bredesen himself is quoted in the news release acknowledging the need for large-scale clinical trials. But the minor use of cautious language in describing the study as “small” and the call for future larger trials do not make up for the intentional muddying of the symptoms of age-related memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease. As the news release points out, Alzheimer’s disease is a huge and growing problem, affecting 5.4 million Americans and creating an economic burden on the health care system. No medications are available to stop its progress. There’s evidence that non-drug interventions that are designed to fight inflammation and improve blood sugar regulation like those in the MEND program could be effective. The MEND program includes the elimination of processed foods, regular exercise, yoga and medication to reduce stress, melatonin to extend sleep, supplements such as fish oil, vitamins D3 and B12, and hormone replacement therapy. However, the MEND treatment protocol involves so many factors it may be difficult to determine which ones are effective. To date nothing has been proven to prevent Alzheimer’s.

Implementation of these guidelines will require much more systematic coordination of stroke care than currently exists. Currently, smaller community hospitals can quickly assess a patient, get an imaging study, and start tPA (clot-busting medication delivered by IV) within an hour or two after symptoms begin. But to assess eligibility for endovascular clot retrieval (the procedure discussed here), and transport patients to centers that provide the highly specialized procedures, could take time.

This news release from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center about a newly approved drug for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare type of skin cancer, missed that chance. We understand the need to get the news out there and even to highlight a patient story, but there is enough evidence on benefits and risks associated with immunotherapy, not to mention costs, that news releases should give readers a fuller picture.

The 5-year survival rate for MCC is estimated at around 60 percent, according to MayoClinic.org. This is the first drug approved for treating MCC — but not the only recognized treatment for the disease.

While the news release indicates that this is pioneering work in the field of personalized prostate cancer treatment, there is still much to be skeptical about the practice of isolating cancer-related genes with new targeted drugs. The key point not made in the news release is that the study did not demonstrate any mortality or survival benefit in the act of identifying and targeting men with mutated prostate tumors and giving them olarparib. The news release comes across somewhat as a promotional vehicle for genetic testing and yet comparing it with the test for BRAC (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutation would tend to give it a gloss it might not deserve. Without results with this form of  “precision medicine,” hyping genetic testing around this type of metastatic prostate cancer feels a little irresponsible. The final line: “Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families” seems to be putting the cart way before the horse and is likely to confuse and build unreasonable expectations among prostate cancer sufferers. Many men still die from prostate cancer and if there were an easy genetic test that could pinpoint which prostate cancer sufferers were most likely to benefit from a targeted drug therapy this could be a huge advance. The news release presents hype and hope yet one has to refer to the published study to find any real information, where the researchers report: “We cannot yet determine whether olaparib improves overall survival among patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA-repair defects.”"

866,866,Most U.S. doctors fail to discuss alcohol with patients: study.,"That practice needs to change, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. An estimated 88,000 people die in the United States each year from drinking too much alcohol, but only one out of six adults overall and one in four binge drinkers have discussed their drinking habits with their doctors, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The percentage of patients who had ever discussed their drinking with a health care provider ranged from a low of 8.7 percent in Kansas to 25.5 percent in Washington, D.C.  Doctors are often too busy to screen patients for alcohol abuse and may view treatment options as ineffective, the CDC said. “Counseling for five, 10, 15 minutes can result in a substantial reduction in problem drinking,” he said. But asking patients about their alcohol use and then offering advice on how to reduce it, or referring the most serious cases for specialized treatment, can be effective in many cases, Frieden said.",true,"Doctors are failing to find out if their patients drink too much alcohol, despite evidence that at least 38 million American adults consume an excessive amount, a U.S. health agency said on Tuesday."

The story does mention that traditional hormone therapy should be evaluated on a case by case basis.",mixture,"The story presents bioidentical hormones as a new option for relieving bothersome symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal discomfort. The story accurately reports that the active ingredients of these supposedly “natural” hormones are the same ones used in synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, these hormones are not as well-regulated or well-tested as synthetic versions. The story provides no evidence that bioidentical hormones are more effective or safer than traditional HRT. Positive testimonials from a physician employee of a bioidentical hormone supplier, a celebrity and women who have experienced reduced menopausal symptoms with  bioidentical hormones are not a substitute for quantitative evidence. The comment that a hormone product can be tailored to a woman's chemistry is not proven. Additionally, the story does not mention the cost of bioidenticals, which are typically about $50/month, similar to the cost of conventional HRT. Any physician can provide a prescription for bioidentical hormones in a routine office visit. The story appropriately stresses that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a disease which necessitates medical intervention. The story also mentions that short-term use of HRT in any form should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause. While the bioindentical hormones are marketed as a natural alternative to balancing hormones and easing bothersome symptoms of hormonal fluctuations during menopause, the story fails to mention the least risky “natural” interventions for managing symptoms of menopause, such as exercise and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats. The story also does not mention non-hormonal, evidence-based pharmaceutical options for managing symptoms. However, using these medications for treatment of hot flashes would be considered an off-label prescription. (See a previous review of a story on this topic.)"

Other breast surgeries could lead to sudden drops in estrogen production, which could induce early menopause in premenopausal women. Could a similar scenario play out here? The high cost of this treatment led to fights with insurers over coverage and finally to a randomized trial that showed no benefit.",true,"This story is about a large retrospective study that was published this week in the journal JAMA Surgery. The research suggests women who opted for surgery to treat their breast cancer had better survival rates than those who didn’t, even though the number of surgeries has plunged from 1988 to 2011. This Washington Post report does many things well: It quantifies the benefits of breast surgery in absolute terms, points out the study’s limitations and doesn’t make sweeping recommendations based on this research. Furthermore, the story uses cautionary language, making readers really question whether surgery is the better option for stage 4 breast cancer patients. It also incorporates two independent sources who provide some critical perspectives, such as the two other small studies that showed no correlation between surgery and survival in this group of women. We would have liked to have seen more discussion on the harms of breast surgeries, as well as the existing therapies for breast cancer patients. And we would have liked for the report to have pointed out that usually younger women underwent surgery in the study, which may have affected the results. Overall, however, the Washington Post puts forth a thorough, nuanced story based on the latest findings. Though current screening recommendations for breast cancer are intended to identify cancers at an earlier, more curable stage of disease, women still present with metastatic disease (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). This can occur because of not having screening or not having it regularly enough, or it may relate to aggressive disease that develops and metastasizes prior to it being detected on standard imaging tests. For those women with metastatic disease, particularly younger ones, cure and thus long-term survival is uncommon. The question addressed in this story is whether the addition of surgery to standard aggressive therapy – generally chemotherapy and radiation treatment – leads to longer survival. The story does a good job of describing the benefit seen in this retrospective study as well as highlighting its limitations. Specifically, there is no evidence from higher quality, prospective studies that surgery provides additional survival benefit. Clearly such studies are needed and the article suggests that such studies are currently underway. The challenge is what to recommend for women who currently face this treatment decision. The simple answer is that we don’t really know and the article does a good job of not overselling surgery based upon the results of this study."

Using a reasonable range of sources, the story nicely sums up the new research and the problems faced by preschoolers with ADHD. The news story says ADHD may afflict a small portion of preschoolers (1% to 4%). But the wide net cast by the story’s diagnostic criteria could ensnare some innocent victims—“extreme symptoms when compared to youngsters of the same age,” including kids who don’t listen, who “drive their families crazy,” and who are injury-prone. Fortunately, a child psychiatrist cautions readers not to “jump on the bandwagon too quickly in making early diagnoses.” Mention of additional criteria–adapted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, for example–might help readers distinguish “extreme” from normal variations in behavior. (New Engl J Med 2005;352:165-73). The story neglects mention of cost or how readers might find professionals to implement the more-intensive program. It might also have provided more context on treatment harms and alternatives. Can behavioral therapy go wrong—and if it can, how might it harm a vulnerable preschooler? The article explains that the main treatment option, medication, is not yet approved for these youngsters. However, it fails to note that behavioral therapies have proven to be less effective as medications in older, school-age kids. (New Engl J Med 2005;352:165-73)."

On the other hand, it is hard to compare alternatives in highly controlled settings. Real life is a lot different. The answer is surprising and worthy of a release, even though the sample size was small and the methodology lacked some real-world challenges (e.g.",mixture,"This release by the Journal of the American Medical Association highlights a relatively small study that could snowball into better lives for tens of millions of people who struggle with hearing loss. The finding: Many personal sound amplification products, or PSAPs, which can be purchased over-the-counter, seem to perform nearly as well as much more expensive, medically prescribed hearing aids when it comes to understanding speech. While the release does discuss and compare costs — a frequently overlooked yet crucial issue, as we often bemoan here at HealthNewsReview.org — it whiffed on quantifying the benefits of using cheaper devices and discussing their harms. Hearing loss affects some 48 million Americans, but Medicare doesn’t cover hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars per ear — this despite the fact that people 65 and older are affected by hearing loss. If over-the-counter devices like PSAPs compare to the aid provided by much more expensive prescription hearing aids, then millions more people with hearing loss may be able to reap the benefits."

However, the only result reported in the conference abstract and draft journal article is an increase in the amount of light that went through the pig skin in the lab, which the authors said “implies” reduced back-scatter or absorption in the skin. Oddly, the abstract of the conference presentation and the upcoming journal article in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine that were mentioned in the release both highlighted concerns about discoloring or burning skin, something not mentioned at all in the release. Claims of improved safety are also not supported by any data. There was no mention in the conference abstract or journal article of any test tattoos or other skin marks on the pig skin, so there is no data presented about the actual ability of the device to remove the “birthmarks, port-wine stains, tattoos” headlining the release.",false,"This news release claims that a device being developed at the University of Missouri could revolutionize treatment to remove tattoos, birth marks and port-wine stains based only on a test on some pig skin…and that pig didn’t even have any tattoos or other markings. The release quotes a researcher who hopes “the procedure will be available widely in the near future.” But there’s no evidence to support that statement either. While the release is peppered with claims that this device that combines laser light with ultrasound pulses will be safer and more effective, that’s not what the experiment tested. The researchers showed only that their device was able to push more laser light through a piece of pig skin than a conventional laser. Their assumption that increasing transmitted optical power will improve clinical effectiveness has yet to be tested. Neither benefits nor harms are put in numerical context. Alternatives are not mentioned. We applaud the release writers for including a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device and highlights potential benefits to the researchers. The release notes that the work was funded by a program to support commercialization of academic research. There are objective statements about research results, and then there are marketing statements in support of a product. This research was supported by a University of Missouri’s FastTrack grant. According to the university’s web site, such grants “are not to be used for basic research, but to evaluate the commercial potential of existing research.” But when journalists and others receive a news release from University of Missouri Health they should be able to trust that academic standards hold more sway than marketing interests."

Among them were domestic violence and child abuse or neglect.The Gang of Eight bill that passed, and that Heitkamp voted for, also toughened the law with regard to domestic violence and child abuse, though it didn’t go as far as the Cornyn amendment. 744: Any alien who has been convicted of a crime of domestic violence, a crime of stalking, or a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment, provided the alien served at least 1 year imprisonment for the crime, or provided the alien was convicted of offenses constituting more than 1 such crime, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, is inadmissible.“Under current law you’re inadmissible (i.e. The CBO said “approximately 8 million of the unauthorized residents already in the country would obtain legal status” under the bill.So the ad overestimates the number of people who would have gained legal status under the bill by 3 million.It also misleadingly says they would have been granted “amnesty.” Those seeking citizenship under the bill would have been required to pay fines and back taxes, prove gainful employment, complete criminal background checks, learn English and civics, and go to the back of the line behind legal immigrants who had already applied for citizenship.As we have written, such an earned path to citizenship does not meet the strict definition of amnesty, which implies that immigrants currently in the U.S. illegally would be granted immediate, permanent residency without any of the requirements listed above.It’s also a curious charge given that the ad faults Heitkamp for opposing the Cornyn amendment, which also would have ultimately allowed a similar path to citizenship for most of those who would have been eligible under the final Gang of Eight bill.Also notable is that Heitkamp was one of only three Democrats who earlier this year voted in support of the Broader Options for Americans Act proposed by Sen.

937,937,Discovery offers prospect of shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia,"There are so many studies in mice that don’t pan out in humans. This release appears to be putting the cart before the horse. The release makes clear that its discovery of a potential weak point in a frustrating form of leukemia has the potential to push CML patients into remission. The release mentions the treatment will be a “Gleevec-like” drug so it’s notable that the costs may also be “Gleevec-like” to start. A large group of physicians wrote in a 2013 cost analysis study in the journal Blood: “We believe the unsustainable drug prices in CML and cancer may be causing harm to patients.” Fortunately, a generic drug should cost $46,000 a year as Gleevec loses patent exclusivity in 2016, according to a recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.",false,"This news release by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is a teaser on a potential new drug target for sufferers of a blood cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, which affects 30,000 Americans a year. The release spends a good amount of space explaining the condition and problems with a standard treatment — a drug called Gleevec (a brand-name version of the drug imatinib) — and how up to 90% of patients with the disease face a lifetime of medication that may eventually stop working. It also does a nice job explaining a biological pathway that helps drive CML and why it might be a mechanism to target in the future, specifically Ezh2 inhibitors. However, the study was done in mice — not people. The release belatedly points this out in the final third of the text — but we would have liked to see it more prominently mentioned. The reason: The relevance may not transfer to people with CML. That’s also why we think the repeated use of the word “cure” and the possibility of shorter treatment in the headline is overstating and misleading. One glaring omission was that of price. The only allusion to price in the news release is an aside in the closing line noting shorter treatment times translate into cost savings. We’re also given no rough treatment cost estimates for an unnamed Ezh2 inhibitor made by Epizyme that’s mentioned in the release. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) develops in bone marrow and affects myeloid cells. Those cells typically mature into platelets or red blood cells, but genetic and other abnormalities can lead them to mature into defunct granulocyte cells, i.e. leukemia. CML patients experience a gradual though sometimes rapid build-up of leukemia in their bones and then in their spleen, crowding out healthy cells over time. This drives symptoms that may include frequent infections (due to immune system weakening), fatigue (fewer red blood cells), and easy bleeding (fewer platelets). CML affects about 30,000 people each year and about 1.2 million to 1.5 million people worldwide, most of them middle-aged adults (though there are a few children). While patients who seek the standard of treatment — imatinib (marketed as Gleevec and Glivec) — receive it “indefinitely,” the median survival is between 5-6 years, since leukemia cells can build up resistance to imatinib-like drugs. In fact, about 80-90% of patients can’t clear all of their leukemia cells and stay on permanent drugs. By increasing the number of CML patients who can drive their cancer into remission, suffering could be dramatically reduced — as would the cost of their treatment. As teased by this release, Ezh2 inhibitors may (or may not) help CML patients. Clinical trials would have to determine if that hypothesis pans out."

Readers are clearly told that while this study provides new insight, there are some key questions that need to be answered before many experts would change their recommendations about aspirin. The only important shortcoming is that it reports only the relative risk reductions without also telling readers about the absolute differences in cancer death rates that the researchers observed. Cancers of all types are second only to heart disease as the cause of death in developed countries. A number of observational studies have suggested that the kind of low-dose aspirin regimen recommended for some people at risk of heart disease may also have some cancer-related benefits. This study attempts to avoid some of the inherent limitations of observational studies by using data that was collected as part of experimental trials that randomized people to take aspirin or a placebo pill.

And neither story discussed the costs of biolgic drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. These drugs can cost $1,500-2,000/month. We think that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about costs. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that, in its more aggressive forms, can produce a good deal of discomfort and disfigurement. Treatments to date have improved but a mainstay drug, methotrexate, is limited in its effectiveness and can have some nasty side effects. Biologic drugs such as Stelara, Humira and Enbrel are somewhat more effective but very expensive. So a story about a new drug that appears effective in very early clinical trials is important."

The release suggests that genetic testing used in the study is better than current methods at forecasting prostate cancer progression; however, this apparent benefit is never quantified and key limitations of the study are never addressed. The tone is promotional, with links to a Fox news program featuring the surgeon quoted, a link to a “ProstateCancer911” website and the surgeon’s phone number for making an appointment for a consult. The study seems secondary at best. About 220,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States annually, according to the American Cancer Society. The vast majority (98 percent) live at least 10 years after diagnosis and 94 percent are alive 15 years after diagnosis. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, the risk for death increases. This study highlights the possibility that men with high-risk gene profiles would be candidates for more aggressive follow-up treatment following removal of their prostates.

Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson’s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban. Lawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings — which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed — as assault weapons.

The story mentions that fluoxetine is â€œoften used to treat anorexiaâ€, but this is an off-label use, which is not mentioned. It’s an important fact to include. The medication is more commonly prescribed for anorexic patients to treat depression and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder, common co-existing mental illnesses in these patients. The story partially describes the study design, but does not mention it was a double-blind, randomized study. The story provides absolute numbers of patients who completed the year-long study and maintained their weight. The story also appropriately notes that the difference in weight maintenance and time to relapse between the fluoxetine group and placebo group was not statistically significant. This was a small study, with less than half of the patients completing treatment, so the results may not be generalizable, especially for patients at earlier and less acute stages of anorexia. The patients in this study were recruited from eating disorders treatment centers and had been suffering with anorexia for several years (average was 4 years). The story mentions that one teenage study participant attempted suicide. Adolescent suicide has been linked to certain anti-depressant medications, including fluoxetine.

Although the news release summarizes the pattern of results—that recently postmenopausal women who received estrogen via a skin patch were found to have “lower” amyloid depositions in their brains relative to those who took estrogen by mouth or who were in the placebo group—that pattern is not explained in any numerical or statistical way. Unfortunately, that doesn’t give readers a feel for the robustness of the relationship, or for the evidence supporting it. The overall implication that there’s a causal relationship, strongly inferred in the headline, earns this a not satisfactory rating.",mixture,"A small pilot study has found that giving recently postmenopausal women estrogen via a patch is associated with reduced depositions of amyloid in the brain (a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) relative to women who received estrogen orally or who took a placebo. Additionally, the study found that the association was strongest among women with a greater genetic risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was carefully done, and the news release offers some useful details about the study’s methods. However, the study included just 68 women, too few to make the patterns found reliable. To its credit, the release quotes the lead author about the need for larger replications. But that begs the question of why the Mayo Clinic seeks to publicize this work at all, particularly with a news release headline that emphasizes disease reduction potential, when the study only looked at amyloid levels, a risk marker. There is very active debate as to whether lowering amyloid will have any impact on actual symptoms or rates of Alzheimer’s disease. A better headline might have been: “Pilot Study Suggests Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women Reduces Amyloid, Marker of Alzheimer’s Risk.” Journalists certainly deserve to know about this study, but they need to keep it in their back pockets until more rigorous clinical studies have been done. Whether estrogen replacement therapy is of value to postmenopausal women is contested territory, and researchers, including those in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study from which this research stems, are trying to explore the contingencies, if any, that distinguish women who could benefit from estrogen supplementation from those who may not. This study adds to a body of work looking at the “timing hypothesis,” that is, the notion that estrogen has different effects in the heart and brain when given to younger postmenopausal woman compared to women in their 60s or 70s. Studies of effects on the heart using intermediate disease markers (carotid artery thickness, analogous to heart disease in the way that amyloid deposition is to Alzheimer disease) in lieu of clinical outcomes (heart attacks, cognitive impairment) have been appearing in journals over the past two years. Considered in this context, the research is of interest but needs to be shared with a strong dose of qualifiers."

With the exception of a recommended 1 or 2 sessions involving weights or exercise machines (which would involve some cost) this intervention would require minimal financial investment. Third, the article clearly contends that the interventions provide a clinical benefit (“reverse damage to sedentary, aging hearts and help prevent risk of future heart failure”) while the study itself only documents improvements in what are essentially lab values: improvement in oxygen intake during exercise and improved left ventricular compliance (ie.",mixture,"Getty Images This news release describes a small study (~50 subjects) from UT Southwestern Medical Center showing that fairly aggressive and regular exercise in sedentary, middle-aged individuals can marginally increase maximum oxygen uptake and moderately improve the elasticity of the main pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle). Although the news release does a good job outlining the prescribed exercise regime, it makes unwarranted and confusing claims about reversing damage from “heart aging,” and suggesting the findings might “help prevent risk of future heart failure.” This language is not justified. The research can’t tell us if risk for heart failure has been reduced in these study participants. Nor does it establish what is meant by “heart aging” and how that has been “reversed” by the intervention. The news release would have been markedly improved if such terms had been dropped, and focused more on what is — and is not known — about poor fitness as a risk factor for heart failure. Cardiovascular health is a major health issue for middle-aged people and their health care providers. It makes research like this very interesting for readers, and we believe that places a premium on clear language. This study had little to do with “heart aging” or even heart failure. So using such language in both the news release title, as well as the opening paragraph, sets up readers to be misguided and misinformed."

The story tells us that the idea behind the procedure was first proposed in 2008, making the concept quite novel.",mixture,"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected. The problem is that in the desperate search for a cure, patients, family and providers can seek out risky and expensive treatments that haven’t been adequately studied."

1045,1045,FDA approves new psoriasis drug,"The FDA evaluates drugs without considering costs, which is why they are not discussed in this news release. Three compared Siliq to placebo, while the remaining two looked at Siliq compared to Ustekinumab (sold under the brand name Stelara). A 2016 FDA briefing document online (page 6, second paragraph) implies that the drug company funded the clinical trials to support its application for FDA approval. This is why we give it a Satisfactory rating here. A FDA director comments that Siliq provides psoriasis patients with “another treatment option.” We feel this is good enough for a Satisfactory rating.",mixture,"The US Food and Drug Administration just approved a new drug to treat psoriasis, a common skin condition that can form thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. Siliq (brodalumab) is mainly intended for patients who don’t respond to other forms of treatment, like anti-inflammatory topical medications and light therapies. The “last resort” recommendation may be due to the four completed suicides that took place during the clinical trial, leading the FDA to believe that Siliq may be correlated to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior — especially in patients with a history of depression. As a result, the FDA is requiring Siliq to be sold with a “boxed warning” (the strictest warning put in the labeling of prescription drugs) and only through a restricted program. The FDA news release devotes a significant chunk to the drug’s potential harms and makes clear who should or shouldn’t be taking Siliq. What’s mainly missing from the release are any numbers to give a sense of the scope of potential benefits and harms. Regarding the drug’s potential benefits, the release uses only vague, comparative wording (“more patients… had skin that was clear or almost clear.”). We don’t know how the participants were selected, how long they were followed up and how their improvement was assessed. Furthermore, a clinical trial was stopped for a period of time due to safety concerns, which was then continued by another drug manufacturer. Although not explicitly stated, it is fair to assume that drug manufacturers also funded these clinical trials. These are study limitations that were never disclosed by the news release. We did find a 90-page FDA briefing document online from 2016, which includes some efficacy data. Curiously, this document mentions five clinical trials instead of three. We’re not sure why the FDA release didn’t include the two other clinical trials that compared Siliq (brodalumab) to ustekinumab. We also reviewed TIME.com’s coverage of this new drug. Specialty drugs treating skin conditions like psoriasis can be expensive. The main competitors to Valeant’s Siliq may be Novartis’ Cosentyx and Eli Lilly’s Taltz — both of which cost at least $16,600 for one dose. Although some of this could be covered by insurance, patients could still be responsible for co-pays, which could amount to thousands of dollars. In addition, if patients have exhausted all existing treatment options and are desperate to clear up their psoriasis, they may be willing to try riskier therapies. If there is a new alternative that is FDA-approved and cost-effective, then it certainly deserves to be reported — as in this case, with strong caveats."

We wonder how these women who were excluded differed in their low-dose aspirin intake from those who developed breast cancer later on. However, these studies can’t prove a causal relationship — i.e., that the action (taking aspirin) caused the result (reduced risk of breast cancer). It’s irresponsible not to mention those risks in the context of a speculative benefit such as breast cancer prevention.",mixture,"The release focuses on a recent paper published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, which addresses breast cancer risk and regular use of aspirin in low doses. While the release states that low doses of aspirin “reduces the risk of breast cancer in women,” there are problems with how the information is presented. Specifically, it’s impossible to know whether the aspirin affected breast cancer risk based on this study. That’s because this was an observational study — meaning that it could detect a correlation between aspirin use and breast cancer, but not whether the use of aspirin was actually responsible for lower rates of breast cancer. That’s a key distinction. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in the United States and is diagnosed in hundreds of thousands of women each year. That means many thousands — if not millions — of women and their loved ones are on the lookout for things they can do to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Telling the public that aspirin reduces cancer risk has the potential to influence the daily decisions of those women, which is problematic when the relevant study is unable to make that determination. What’s more, daily aspirin use can cause or exacerbate other health problems, which this release does not address at all."

1064,1064,Lack of affordable healthcare accounts for a greater number of deaths per year than do terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined.,"Recent debates about healthcare in general, and former president Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in particular, have often featured claims about the number of avoidable deaths caused by a lack of affordable healthcare. However, it’s unlikely that any research model could arrive at a definitive estimate of the number of people who die premature and avoidable deaths each year as a result of their inability to access health insurance. A couple of unofficial but robust sources of data on deaths from terrorist attacks in the United States have been active in recent years. Several studies have shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crime in general at a lower rate than native-born Americans. Lack of affordable healthcare accounts for a greater number of deaths per year than do terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined.",mixture,"What's true: Terrorist acts and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants account for a relatively very small portion of all violent deaths in the United States, and some research has concluded that the lack of affordable healthcare causes many more deaths each year. What's false: No consensus exists about either the methodology or definitions that should be employed in researching the number of deaths caused each year by lack of access to affordable healthcare, nor about that number itself."

However, the story missed the mark in several ways: It didn’t mention the potential harms of taking fish oil if you’re a post-heart attack patient, nor did it discuss costs of the intervention. The only person quoted is the lead researcher of the study–an independent source was needed. Lastly, several limitations of the study are not discussed, including that many patients did not return for post-treatment follow-up. Fish oil is a widely used health supplement. Notwithstanding dozens of rigorous studies that cast doubt on its actual health benefits, the popularity of fish oil supplements remains unabated. Most studies have looked at the preventive benefits of fish oil in high-risk populations. The study reported here, on the other hand, examines the protective benefits of fish oil in patients right after a heart attack. The results suggest that high doses of fish oil after a heart attack may have modest benefits, based on measurements of things like scarring and heart function, which are surrogate markers. News coverage ideally points out this fact–that these markers can’t tell us if fish oil actually reduces the risk of a repeat heart attack, death or other cardiac event."

1086,1086,Lung Cancer Breath ‘Signature’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis,"As noted above under “Why This Matters,” the concern is that using this test to guide surveillance testing (whether to order the CT) could be a problem if the test is not actually very accurate when used in that role — false positive and particularly false negative results could lead to harms. The news release might have more appropriately stated that the breath test is being evaluated as a tool to monitor for disease recurrence — not being used as a tool. While the release doesn’t claim to be “first,” it might have mentioned related work that has been done in this field of research. In addition, the comment about FDA approval doesn’t give us any sense of the hurdles/obstacles that remain before the test would be validated for clinical use. Lung Cancer Breath ‘Signature’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis",mixture,"Image courtesy University of LouisvilleThis release discusses a study testing the efficacy of a test using the breath of lung cancer patients. Since patients with lung cancer are known to have specific chemicals in their breath — known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — which are caused by the disease, detecting them after the patients underwent surgery could indicate a recurrence of the disease. These chemicals are, in effect, markers for the presence of disease. The release notes the study showed a reduction in the amount of these compounds after patients had undergone surgical resection of the lung, but doesn’t give any numerical information about the level of reduction, other than to say it is “significant.” The release provides a nice description of costs and describes the test’s potential benefit to reduce harm from repeat CTs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States with 224,000 new diagnoses each year and 158,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Both early detection and successful monitoring of disease recurrence might reduce those numbers considerably. Current monitoring for lung cancer recurrence after surgery is based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. A breath test using chemical markers to detect recurrence could potentially be cheaper, simpler and less risky than repeat CT scans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a positive breath test would still necessitate a follow-up CT scan and with almost every screening test, there is a risk of missed diagnosis."

She makes this argument by correctly stating that diphtheria is caused by a strain of bacteria (Corynebacterium diphtheria) and by correctly stating that vaccination does not prevent transmission of those bacteria. Although the risk of a school-aged child’s contracting the disease is lower than an adult’s, the risk to the former of being chronically infected from the disease is significantly higher. Second, uninfected C. diphtheria bacteria are less likely to be spread between individuals in the first place, meaning the vaccine quite literally reduces the chances that the disease will be transferred between individuals.

1098,1098,Breakthrough study demonstrates survival advantage with immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced kidney cancer patients,"The news release fails to note that the study was funded by the manufacturer of nivolumab (Bristol Myers Squibb) and that Dr. Sharma is a consultant to the company. The release makes it clear that “Nivolumab, marketed as Opdivo, is currently used to treat metastatic melanoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer.”  However it is silent on the availability of everolimus (Afinitor). Cancer treatments are very (some would same ridiculously) expensive and the two treatments highlighted in this release are no exception. Examples: “breakthrough” … “this is a new way forward” … “this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients” … “portends paradigm change.” However, the term “breakthrough” is technically consistent with the FDA designation of nivolumab as a “Breakthrough Therapy.” We’ve been critical of that designation because we think it skews patient expectations and may set them up for disappointment. But since the main alternative is the treatment used in the trial, this may be a moot point.",mixture,"News releases from academic centers can fall victim to the hyperbole and excessive optimism often seen in the commercial realm. This release from MD Anderson Cancer Center avoids the worst excesses and we liked much of what was written, including the description of the study design and quantification of the survival benefit. But some important omissions are evident. We can perhaps forgive the release for not including a discussion of cost. But there were other significant deficiencies, including lack of a meaningful discussion on potential harms of the treatment, no mention of the study funding source, and no disclosure that the principal investigator (quoted extensively in the release) is a consultant to the manufacturer of nivolumab. These are important elements to help readers understand the true extent of this “breakthrough.”  Although a somewhat uncommon form of cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important topic. As is noted by the news release, a significant number of patients with the disease present with metastases making treatment difficult. Existing therapies are not ideal with only moderate improvements in survival. The demonstration of an immunotherapy for RCC that is more effective than existing treatments is encouraging. We should note that the “breakthrough designation” from the FDA  is “… intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of potential clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible” (our emphasis added)."

This is an important first step.” It also notes that further research is planned. After the study’s first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as “severe,” and 40 percent rated them as “moderate.” The release explains that half of the participants in the study received the 5 fluorouacil cream and the other half received a cream lacking that ingredient. That suggests the cream is widely available.",true,"Getty Images This release reports on a large multi-center clinical trial intended to gauge the preventative value of using a cream containing 5 percent fluorouacil as a means of reducing the occurrence of both squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinomas. It says that the cream appears to reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinomas among the elderly veterans in the trial by 75 percent, although it has no statistically significant effect on reducing basal cell carcinomas. The release also states that the protection appears to only extend for the first year. The release omits mention of the drug’s hefty price tag but it does clearly state both the benefits and the risks of using the medicinal cream. These skin cancers — squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas — are among the most common forms of cancer afflicting Americans and to date, the only effective preventative has been the use of sunscreen with varying success. This trial suggest a two-to-four week-long application of this cream can reduce the risk of developing one kind of skin cancer by as much as 75 percent for one year. Given the costs of treating these cancers, both in money and resources, this finding, if borne out, is a positive step in reducing the burden that cancer places on society."

What does it do to a person who receives this news? How long have they been used for this purpose? Using PET Scans to Discover Early Signs of Alzheimer’s,false,"Alzheimer’s disease is a common and tragic disease. In spite of much research, there is currently little that can be done to stop or slow its progression. A hot area of research is in early detection. Two years ago, Medicare decided to cover PET scanning for diagnosing Alzheimer’s, with the hope that it could help with treatment and allow patients and their families to help with future planning. However, Medicare’s decision was very controversial and there are many issues surrounding the use of PET scanning for this conditon. This story does little to enlighten readers and is flawed in several ways. The story does not attempt to quantify the benefits of PET scanning. Most importantly, the story does not mention that even if Alzheimer’s is detected early, there is not much that can be done for it. The drug Aricept has only minor effects on the progression of the disease. Although the story mentions neurologic exams, the advantages and disadvantages of PET scanning compared to existing approaches are not described. How will the scanning fit in with current practice? These questions are not answered in the story. The story does not comment on the novelty or availability of PET scanning. Although the story hints at false alarms, this is insufficient information on the harms of scanning. How do such “false alarms” impact peoples’ lives? The story does quote two directors of major Alzheimer’s research centers. The story could have quoted other clinicians or researchers who could have provided some additional perspective. By accurately describing the prevalence of Alzheimer’s, the story avoids disease mongering. The story does mention that the scans are expensive – $1000 to $3500 and are not necessarily covered by insurance. The story could have provided costs of the traditional neurologic exam by comparison."

And while the study failed to demonstrate benefit in management of knee OA, the article included a quote from a patient who uses the supplements and believes they are effective (though whether the individual has knee OA is not clear). Thus the story seems to balance one individual anecdote against the weight of evidence from a study of 1,583 people. People with more severe pain from knee OA probably would want to know the type of chondroitin used in the study as it is not the most common form of the supplement available.

Private insurers and Medicaid programs are frequently able to achieve discounts at this level.” The published study did address cost in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The release makes several statements about benefits to an entire population, not necessarily the benefits to an individual patient. Data was drawn from a previous trial to model health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the drug over a 30-year period. Entresto was compared to enalapril and found to be associated with — on average —  a year longer of survival as well as reduced hospital admissions.",true,"This news release summarizes a study that estimated the benefits of sacubitril/valsartan (marketed as Entresto) vs enalapril (an ACE-inhibitor) in treating heart failure patients with lowered ejection fraction (the amount of blood pumped from the heart). In the study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology, researchers created a statistical model that estimated that about 28,000 patients per year with heart failure and a lowered ejection fraction could benefit from Entresto, a twice-daily pill approved in 2015. The model found that patients on Entresto lived a year longer, on average, than those treated with enalapril, and that the medication was “cost effective” when used with concurrent standard therapies. The release from the drugmaker, Novartis, describes their complex analysis and highlights their conclusion that the heart failure medication is cost effective. But the release does not include any discussion of the extremely high cost of the drug. An estimated 6 million people in the United States have heart failure, and about half of those with heart failure also have reduced ejection fraction, so any treatment for them matters for their individual health and for society’s costs of overall health treatment. The release states that the analysis reinforces a strong recommendation from several medical societies that the condition be treated with sacubitril/valsartan. This release about the statistical model of effectiveness for the drug Entresto claims that it could delay or prevent thousands of deaths per year, but does not include analysis that the total cost of treating the majority of those eligible could drastically tax the health system. A 2015 story in Kaiser Health News reports on a nonprofit analysis that raised questions about the cost-effectiveness of Entresto."

The study, which demonstrates that caloric restriction may improve memory in older people, delivers the essential findings adequately, mentions some key caveats, includes comments from three experts and places these findings in the context of previous work done with animals and humans. But the report fails to look beyond the narrow findings and answer important questions people will want to know as they [understandably] imagine how they might put these findings to practical use:  1. How much/little food did the restriction group eat? A 30 percent restriction for someone eating 2,000 calories per day is 1,400 calories; for someone eating 1,700 per day, that’s 1,190. Those are tough numbers. People would want to know that. 2. Is it clear the results were due to caloric restriction, not weight loss? This is the proverbial caveat big enough to drive a truck through, yet it was not mentioned. 3. Is it safe for older people–or anybody–to restrict calories by 30 percent? The failure to take up that last question is particularly serious. Older people who are not overweight could wind up malnourished if they tried to restrict their calorie intake by 30 percent. Other news organizations mentioned this prominently in their stories. The Times should have too."

1131,1131,Omega-3 Fatty Acids May Lower Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Obese Women,"The release notes that the omega-3 fatty acid supplement used in this study, Lovaza, is FDA approved and requires a prescription from a physician. We’ll give it a pass for reinforcing in at least two places that the research builds on previous research and the understanding that highly dense breasts are associated with greater risk for breast cancer. The researchers note in the manuscript that other trials have found that Raloxifene does not have an effect on breast density although it could have an effect on breast cancer risk. In stories and releases focusing on cancer risk, the public wants, and rightly deserves, real numbers so that they can make informed decisions. The release fails to mention two differing doses among the women receiving the drug Raloxifene.",mixture,"This release describes the results of a study testing whether omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer in obese women by reducing the density of their breast tissue. Higher breast tissue density is recognized as a marker for increased breast cancer risk. The study involved a small group of women who received the omega-3 fatty acid, the omega-3 in tandem with a chemo-preventative drug Raloxifene, the drug alone, or no treatment at all. According to the release, at the end of two years, women considered obese (their body mass index — BMI — was greater than 29) showed a reduction in breast tissue density, which the researchers argued reduced their cancer risk. However, this is misleading. This finding is from a small subgroup of obese women within the already-small study. The main finding of the study — which is never even mentioned in the news release — is that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density whether taken alone or in tandem with Raloxifene. The release also omitted projected costs and harms of the prescription-only supplement used in the study. The American Cancer Society predicts that 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year and that more than 40,000 women will die from this disease. Easy actions that women can take to prevent this disease, or at least reduce their risk of getting it, are of almost universal interest to the public. If it is shown that taking a readily available supplement like omega-3 fatty acids will reduce breast cancer risk in obese women, that’s information that will be of wide interest."

The story repeats the relative risk reduction of major cardiovascular events of 25% that the company provided. The story reports that Vascepa costs about $2,400 per year. However, when the first quote calls this drug “absolutely the most significant study in the field of cardiovascular risk reduction since the statins were introduced”, it is not enough to identify the source as “a Vascepa study investigator” when that researcher, Matthew Budoff, received over $120,000 in 2017 from Amarin, including payments of more than $4000 per appearance for speaking and teaching engagements on behalf of the company.",mixture,"A 25% reduction in cardiovascular events, including death, heart attack or stroke sounds like a big deal… and maybe it is. But this story about the results of a trial of a prescription drug derived from fish oil (brand name Vascepa) relies on a news release and company statements that don’t provide basic information about the precise number or type of cardiovascular events observed by researchers. Without absolute numbers, it is impossible to judge the importance of these results. It is also premature to claim that the results represent “heart-medicine history,” especially given that the findings haven’t been peer-reviewed and are at odds with numerous previous studies. The story takes a cheerleading tone and fails to supply key context. For example, it highlights a dramatic quote from a researcher without noting that he was paid over $120,000 by the drug company, including payments for speeches and other appearances on its behalf, in 2017. The story headline and text do make clear that only patients with cardiovascular disease and high levels of triglycerides or diabetes were in the trial, so it should be clear to readers that this drug was not shown to prevent disease in healthy people. The story does not give any details about potential harms of the drug. It reports key details of the trial, but without access to the full trial report, it is impossible to judge the quality of the evidence or its real significance. This story is based on the news release claim of a 25% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. But what does that mean? It’s difficult to say, because that outcome consists of a combination of cardiovascular disease death, heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization procedures (placing a stent in a blocked artery) and hospitalization for unstable angina (chest pain). Based on what little we know, it is possible that the 25% reduction was driven mainly by a lower rate of hospitalizations for chest pain — an outcome that’s less important and also more subject to bias on the part of investigators who decide which patients get hospitalized and which ones don’t. It’s possible there was little or no reduction in deaths, heart attacks or strokes. Until the full trial results are released, we simply don’t know."

How do the results reported here compare with those treatments? Also, not mentioned anywhere is that PSA testing as a routine cancer screen is not recommended anymore. The release does a good job of noting that this is not the first time a link has been suggested between gum and prostate disease and refers to previous studies by the research group.",mixture,"This news release from Case Western Reserve University sets out to describe a relatively small study designed to further previous evidence for an observed link between gum disease and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate). The study focuses on the likely common denominator of a body-wide biological process that releases inflammatory cytokines into blood and tissue, along with other possibilities; and on the clear possibility that non-surgical dental treatment will help. The study report in the journal Dentistry goes to some lengths to caution readers about the very shaky nature of this evidence and the fact that the study was not designed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontitis (the fancy name for inflammatory gum disease) and high PSA levels in the blood of men with prostatitis symptoms. The study authors also lay out several caveats and limitations of their study, including the small number of participants and lack of a control group. Alas, the release fails to exercise that same wise caution. It misleadingly refers to PSA reductions that were not statistically significant, and states flatly that “Treating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation.” This overstates the value of the evidence presented in the study. Both periodontal disease and prostate disease (inflammation, tissue and tooth loss, and cancer) are widespread and have serious health consequences. Indeed, as the release and study point out, the suspected inflammatory process involved in both has also been linked to some forms of heart disease and autoimmune forms of arthritis. As a result, promoting dental care for gum disease as a means of reducing PSA levels and prostatitis (potential precursor signs of prostate cancer) poses a tantalizing means of controlling real health problems. Promoting evidence that supports the value of dental therapy in this context, however, should be accompanied by caution about the well-known debates over the meaning of high or low  PSA levels (especially in younger men and with only a single PSA test); and caution as well about the limitations of self-reported symptoms of prostatitis in a study with no control group. The authors of the study provide important context on these issues; we wish the news release had followed that lead."

The study was not designed to see whether this approach was better than the approach currently used, or if it helped some people with metastatic melanoma live longer. Yet, the headline states: Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma. The sub-headline asserts, “the new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time.” And the first paragraph asserts that “a treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma … live longer.” None of that is known yet. It also is notable that the release made no mention of side effects among patients given this combination of therapies–even though that’s what this trial was examining.

1159,1159,Study shows therapy improves quality of life in people who have sleep apnea.,"Other treatments include dental appliances, surgery, and nerve stimulation. Including this information would have helped readers to draw their own conclusions on this question. However, it neglected to note that the first author has ties to two industry companies (Phillips Respironics and ResMed), both of which make money on the sale and upkeep of CPAP machines and supplies. These limitations should have been included in the news release as well. The release mentioned that there were over 2,000 people in the study, that it was conducted over a period of four years, and that scores on two different questionnaires were used to measure benefits.",false,"This news release from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine describes a large retrospective study that shows that positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy improves quality of life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. PAP therapy is often given via CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, and has been a standard treatment for sleep apnea for several decades. The release does a good job describing the study itself, and how the authors broke down patients into subgroups that compared age and socio-economic status. But the release also left much to be desired: it didn’t describe the limitations of retrospective studies or adequately discuss the harms or costs of these machines, which can be prohibitively expensive for some patients. Most importantly, the news release did not do a good job of establishing the novelty of this study. While there was a large sample size and various measures of quality of life, it is still unclear how this study is new since the benefits of CPAP are already well known. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition in the United States (and the world). It affects about 20 million adult Americans each year, and significantly decreases quality of life due to poor sleep. Sufferers of sleep apnea report daytime symptoms as well, which can include drowsiness, moodiness, headaches, and lack of energy. However sleep apnea is also a well-studied condition, and it is already known that there are several interventions, including use of a CPAP machine, that can help improve symptoms and quality of life. It would be more newsworthy if the researchers had learned something different or new about CPAP treatment or sleep apnea, instead of re-establishing what has already been known for years. The most interesting thing from this news release was that those in lower socio-economic subgroups seemed to benefit less from PAP therapy–perhaps this is a region worth further study."

They add it is currently unclear what dose and particular formulation of the supplement will be most helpful.” The published article is 58 pages long, so it is not surprising that a story can’t do it all in reporting on the results. “But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be be done very carefully.”  All appropriate caveats. The researchers did not study nasal zinc remedies, however.In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Matrixx Initiatives to stop selling its widely used supplement Zicam after more than 130 users reportedly lost their sense of smell.” The story talked about how this review fits into the growing amount of research around zinc. “Singh said the side effects of zinc lozenges, which can be bought for a few dollars in any drug store in the U.S., come down to bad taste and some cases of nausea.",mixture,"It begins well, saying, “A new look at the medical evidence shows zinc supplements may take the edge off the common cold. But not a whole lot.” That’s a more realistic assessment of the evidence than the more enthusiastic beginning to the WebMD story on the same subject. At the same time, this story could have done a better job providing details from the review and quantifying the benefits in a transparent way. We also wish it had brought in some outside perspectives, which could have offered some important insights. But let’s not lose sight of the strong points:  for the second straight day, Reuters Health (and this same reporter) led with caution while others trumpeted findings. Note how the WebMD had an early quote, “This is great news.” And the NY Times’ first sentence said it “may be the next best thing” to a cure. To quote the title of an evidence-based health care column in the Times, “Really?”  Although most of us view the common cold as a mere nuisance, the infection can have serious clinical and economic impact. The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 Million is spent annually in the US for over the counter remedies. Unfortunately, the common cold is also responsible for significant number of prescriptions for antibiotics despite the fact that antibiotics do not work against viral infections. The common cold can also trigger ear infections, sinusitis and worsen lung disease. The Cochrane review of published studies assessing the value of a number of different zinc products as both preventives and for treatment provides a new look at a long standing question; Do zinc salts provide any benefit in the treatment or prevention of the common cold?

Conversely, we wish this story had included more of the information necessary to give readers a complete picture of the benefits of this type of screening for cancer. Smoking rates and the incidence of lung cancer have been falling in the US for several years. Despite these gratifying trends, about 225,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 and approximately 157,000 will die from the disease. A major factor in survival after diagnosis is early detection. Chest X-rays are not sensitive enough to pick up lung cancer in its early stages. That is why more sophisticated diagnostic testing has been sought. Spiral computerized tomography (CT) has been touted as the best way to diagnose lung cancer early and save ives. This landmark study has demonstrated that spiral CT’s are indeed more senstive than chest X-rays and that early detection can save lives. The study is by no means a complete answer, and it raises many questions. Who should be screened, when, how often and who is going to pay the enormous bill are some of the obvious questions. Stories like this need to give the evidence an independent and critical analysis to help readers understand whether more screening is necessarily better for identifying lung cancer and saving lives."

The treatment involves implanting an electrical device which intermittently blocks the vagus nerve, which is involved with feelings of hunger and satiety. The segment does a few things well:   It introduces a patient who, one month into the therapy, has had promising but not spectacular results. It repeatedly mentions that the procedure is experimental, not yet available and unapproved for use in the U.S. It makes clear that VBLOC appears to be less effective than gastric bypass surgery, with possible weight loss of 20 percent at six months compared to 50 percent for bypass. But the segment could have been stronger:   It should have included at least one fully independent expert who could put the technique into perspective It should have provided more detail about the state and quality of the research upon which the promising results are based It should have emphasized the potential harms of the treatment, not the least of which is that it might not work for some people.

It was accurate in the portrayal of the novelty of the approach. The same as original articles?,mixture,"This was a story about a method described in a recently published letter to the journal Nature Medicine for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. While providing some details of the results outlined in the letter, the story failed to provide context to help readers understand the risks and benefits that might be associated with the kind of test described. The story failed to mention that if the test were to be demonstrated to have utility for early identification of Alzheimer’s disease, its initial greatest benefit would probably come from identifying individuals who might then participate in clinical trials to develop treatments for improved management of the condition. The story did a good job in:   providing actual numbers (e.g., test was positive for Alzheimer’s disease in 38 out of 42 patients….) and % accuracy rate  using a lot of cautionary phrases (e.g., ""preliminary studies"") and has specific caution that will be at least 2 years before available (after further testing) and ""…all technologies a long way from being available in clinics"". However, the story doesn’t give much discussion about the specific limitations of this study. For example, this case-control type of patient selection almost always overestimates test accuracy. So it’s likely to perform worse in real world populations. The story also didn’t comment on the fact that the publication in the journal Nature Medicine was actually a letter – which is curious and almost demands comment. Although methods are published, why was it not published as an original article about original research? As a letter, was it peer-reviewed? The same as original articles? When a news story discusses the potential of a new test for Alzheimer’s disease – a topic of great public interest – questioning the quality of the evidence is a key issue."

New Breast Reconstruction Technique Provides Better Outcomes, Less Discomfort for Women Recovering From Breast Cancer However, none of them — one-stage implant surgeries, muscle flap surgeries, etc. We’re told The Valley Hospital performed this surgery, and — by implication of going through the effort of issuing a news release — we have to assume the hospital plans to perform this surgery again for patients who qualify. But all we get is a vague mention to “ongoing research.” What and where are these studies?",false,"It’s hard to ignore a news release that claims a reconstructive breast surgery technique is “innovative” and “has the potential to be a ‘game-changer,'” as does this one from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. The release focuses on the outcome of one 43-year-old woman who received the hospital system’s first attempt at the surgery and is quoted extensively in the release. The procedure in question is available to some women who get a mastectomy following diagnosis, yet want an implant to recreate the appearance of their breast or breasts. After the breast tissue is removed, a balloon-like sac is temporarily placed in the void left behind and gradually filled with fluid. This prepares the skin and muscles nearby for a permanent implant, which is typically inserted a couple of months later for “an excellent aesthetic outcome.” This all sounds wonderful, but our review team (which includes a breast surgeon) thought the release was nearly devoid of crucial context. It doesn’t adequately discuss costs, risks, evidence, or alternatives, and it doesn’t make clear how this procedure differs from similar, more common implant techniques. It also trumpets the outcome of one woman, whose experience with the procedure — while extremely positive — may not hold true for many women who elect to have mastectomies. At best, this release is an incomplete advertisement. Electing to have breast surgery is often an extraordinarily difficult decision: Every patient’s cancer, her risks, and her needs are different. And while it’s nice to have options for reconstructive breast surgery — a topic that’s important to women affected by breast cancer — the advantages or disadvantages of one procedure over another seems to become less clear as more techniques become available. That’s why it’s increasingly important for medical institutions that promote the latest-and-greatest cosmetic procedure make clear its place in a cornucopia of alternatives, and adequately discuss the risks of surgeries that may have little or no bearing on survival or other critical outcomes."

In addition, the research study also examined the use of analgesia pump use in adolescents which was not covered in the story.",true,"First, let’s be clear that this is a review of an Associated Press story as shortened by the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Some of the flaws commented on were not present in the original AP story. The story was about a 10-year retrospective study of adverse events resulting from adolescent use of insulin pumps conducted by the FDA and published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics. Insulin pumps are being used more often to deliver insulin to the body through a plastic tube with a small tip that inserts under the skin. The article provides a good description of the pumps, indicating that they are approximately the size of a cell phone and can be worn on a belt or kept in a pocket. Insulin pumps have been primarily used by adults but are now being used more often by adolescents because it allows them to lead more normal lives by eliminating the need for them to give themselves insulin injections in public. The results of adverse events reported by in the FDA study, including 13 deaths and more than 1,500 pump-related injuries over the past decade, were accurately presented. However, no denominator was given so the numbers lose context and meaning. Estimated causes of these adverse events – patient misuse, lack of education, and device malfunction – were also described. A notable omission from the story was the importance of parental supervision as three of the 13 deaths occurred when there was no adult supervision. The original AP story provided a good overall summary of the health concerns related to insulin pump use among adolescents and the need for for more study to address safety concerns.

We’re not aware of any harms from incorporating additional fiber into one’s diet by eating more fruits and vegetables. For example, a 2012 paper in the Annals of Oncology looked at 16 earlier studies on dietary fiber and breast cancer risk. However, if a story focuses on the importance of a healthy diet, there should ideally be at least a brief acknowledgment that many people do not have access to the foods that make up a healthy diet. It also gets high marks for highlighting the fact that the study required women to “recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s.” (Though, worth noting, that sentence should say “…in their 30s, 40s and 50s.”) No disease mongering here.",mixture,"This story focuses on a recent study from the journal Pediatrics, which found that women who ate more dietary fiber during adolescence and young adulthood had a lower risk of developing breast cancer. The story does a nice job of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the study — as does a competing story we reviewed from NPR. However, as with the NPR story, this story would have been even better if it had explained that the 16% lower risk of cancer was a relative risk reduction, and that the absolute difference was a mere 0.2 percentage point. Moreover, the story would have been improved by the use of more appropriate language in the headline — this type of study can’t tell us whether fiber “may help cut breast cancer risk,” and the story should’ve reflected that uncertainty in its headline description. According to the CDC, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, with more than 224,000 new cases reported in 2012 alone. Findings that early life experiences (diet and behavior) affect later chance of malignancy and heart disease are beginning to emerge.

The release falls victim to the common practice of hyperbole in its headline. This was a phase II trial in a relatively small number of subjects.

The disease can have a significant impact on quality of life, and treatment can be extraordinarily expensive, so information about new, effective treatment options is certainly worth noting. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. While psoriasis itself is not life-threatening, because it is an autoimmune disease, some pharmaceutical treatment options affect the immune system and can increase a patient’s risk of infections — and those infections may pose a significant health risk of their own. This makes it particularly important for readers to be aware of potential health risks associated with new treatment options."

Rather, he provided inspiration for it by showing NFL executives photos of Native American leaders that he believed should be part of the Washington team's brand."
1224,1224,"The UK is performing 240,000 Covid-19 tests a day.","The answer will help explain whether these cells play a key role in the vaping-related outbreak that has killed seven people and sickened 530 so far. One possibility: The deposits are residue from inhaling vaping oils, such as those containing the marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or vitamin E acetate. Some researchers suspect the oils are formed inside the lungs as part of the body’s natural response to chemicals found in many commercial vaping devices. Investigators at the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have pointed to THC vaping oils or vitamin E, a substance used in some THC products, as a possible cause of these illnesses. Meanwhile, forensic chemists at the FDA are testing more than 150 products to determine whether there is a common ingredient that may help explain the illnesses.",mixture,The U.S. investigation into hundreds of cases of life-threatening lung illnesses related to vaping has turned up a curious abnormality: Many of the victims had pockets of oil clogging up cells responsible for removing impurities in the lungs.
1225,1225,What is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress.,"That could mean Obama philosophically believes that Congress should ultimately decide the fate of marijuana, even if his administration has some control over it. While Obama may feel that way philosophically, there is a process by which the executive branch can reclassify marijuana to allow for its medical use or completely remove it from the list of controlled substances. And to be clear, it does. In 2001 and 2011 the DEA, citing FDA research, turned down petitions to reclassify marijuana, and in 2006, the FDA upheld that ""smoked marijuana has no currently accepted or proven medical use in the United States."" But it’s complicated and not without roadblocks.",mixture,"Obama said ""what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress."" While Obama may feel that way philosophically, there is a process by which the executive branch can reclassify marijuana to allow for its medical use or completely remove it from the list of controlled substances. It’s not an easy process, but it’s there. And Obama’s Justice Department has often given tacit approval, or at least turned a blind eye, when states have taken steps to ignore the federal government’s classification."
1226,1226,Researchers produce first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia,"The release mentions the antigen being studied, BD584, “was able to reduce chlamydial shedding – a symptom of C. trachomatis – by 95 per cent.” Without any context for how many people (or mice in this case) were studied, we have no way of knowing what that means. All of this makes the comments about the potential benefits for human trachoma infections even more absurd. This is the biggest omission in the release and truly surprising for a university. Although the release is misleading about the study cohort, it is a novel study given the absence of any available chlamdyia vaccines. (We imagine that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training.)",false,"In many ways, this release provides much of the basic information reporters would need to determine how newsworthy the findings are. Where it was published. The specific antigen being studied and for which disease. A numerical breakdown of the benefits. But nowhere does it mention that this was a study conducted in mice and that, if past experiences with vaccines for other diseases hold true, a true vaccine for humans has a narrow chance of becoming a reality. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says the condition is easily treated, but if left untreated, can make it difficult for a woman to become pregnant A further complication of chlamydia is that it often carries no symptoms, so someone who is infected may not even know it. A safe and effective vaccine would certainly be of public health interest. But this research has to far to go before it will be available to the public — if ever."
1227,1227,A medical examiner's conclusion that Health and Human Services drug pricing adviser Daniel Best died of multiple blunt force injuries contradicts the official ruling that he committed suicide.,"Add to the very few actual articles on his death — this man was described as one of Trump’s “senior” HHS officials working with Alex Azar. Two weeks later, on 15 November, the office of Washington, D.C.’s chief medical examiner announced that Best had died of “multiple blunt force injuries.” His death was ruled a suicide. Repeatedly?” Another conspiracy-mongering website, Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, posed the same sarcastic question: So did he lie down under a garage door and let it hit him “multiple times” or did he beat himself to death with a baseball bat? A statement released the same day by Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Alex Azar mourned Best as a “friend and colleague” but addressed neither the circumstances nor the cause of his death. pic.twitter.com/qiWNH0epeQ — Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) November 17, 2018  Another ‘suicide’ the Media is ignoring.",false,"To date, we aren’t privy to a full account of how Daniel Best sustained his injuries, nor their precise nature, nor any other evidence (such as a suicide note, if one exists) that prompted medical examiners to conclude that he killed himself. But there is clearly nothing contradictory about his having suffered blunt force injuries during the commission of a suicide. Given the facts at hand, there is no reasonable basis for speculation to the contrary."

1229,1229,A photograph shows an eagle catching a drone. ,"Nature defeats Technology”:  This photograph received hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook, but many viewers weren’t exactly sure what this photograph depicted. Bald eagles were taken off the Endangered Species List less than ten years ago, which is about 15 minutes in evolutionary time. It was taken by photographer Koen Van Weel in March 2016 and documents a trained eagle from the “Guard from Above” company wrapping its talons around a drone during a police exercise in the Netherlands. In February 2019, an image supposedly showing an eagle catching a drone was widely circulated on Facebook along with the caption “The Picture of the Century. If an eagle were to misjudge its attack, or if the drone operator were to take evasive or defense maneuvers, a bird could be struck by the blades and seriously injured or killed … Even if birds are well trained and are unexpectedly effective at avoiding rotors, how many eagles are we willing to risk if something goes wrong?",true,"In nature, birds of prey often overpower large and dangerous prey. Their talons have scales, which protect them, naturally, from their victims’ bites. The Dutch National Police has asked the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) to research the possible impact on the birds’ claws. The results are not yet known. Of course, we are continuously investigating any extra possible protective measures we can take in order to protect our birds."
